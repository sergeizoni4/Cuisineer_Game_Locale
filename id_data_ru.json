    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP02_NIGHT_01": "I treasure my friendship with Orzo. He keeps me grounded to my roots.",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP02_DAY_00": "When we were younger, Fusilli and I used to draw pasta shapes on the fountain!",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP02_DAY_01": "I see kids today climbing trees and I think, I used to do that too! How funny!",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP02_NIGHT_00": "If you think about it, this town hasn't changed much. People get older, but they're still the same.",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP02_NIGHT_01": "I love Paell the way it is. I hope it continues to stay the same!",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP02_DAY_00": "'*yawn* I was up late thinking of new flavour concepts again...'",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP02_DAY_01": "Sweet Days are the best days, you know why? Because I don't need to work!",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP02_NIGHT_00": "Some days I wish I lived in the city! There'd be so much more nightlife to see!",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP02_NIGHT_01": "I like to talk to Ankhiluun! They have some really crazy and interesting stories from their travels!",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP02_DAY_00": "I like to catch up on some reading on my off days. Otherwise I'll visit Briquette - I find her rather fun to be around.",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP02_DAY_01": "Some say our bobas are too sweet, but our regulars always come back for more!",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP02_NIGHT_00": "Evening walks around the fountain are possibly the best things about living in Paell.",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP02_NIGHT_01": "It's not exactly quiet at night. I look forward to the nocturnal creatures performing their evening symphony in the woods.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP02_DAY_00": "I must say, the rumours about you aren't entirely accurate. You're much cuter than I thought you'd be.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP02_DAY_01": "I find you rather intriguing Pom. I've heard a lot of stories about you from your peers.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP02_NIGHT_00": "Apologies if I've intruded in your personal reflections. I was just admiring the evening scenery.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP02_NIGHT_01": "Strolling under the moonlight is a rather romantic notion, but I must be on my way. Do stay safe, little kitty.",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP02_DAY_00": "I heard Alder helped out with ya restaurant! That was a good idea, he's got some neat craftsmanship!",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP02_DAY_01": "I hope my neighbours don't complain... I tend to stay up late inventin' in my workshop!",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP02_NIGHT_00": "I'm not sure what I would have done if I wasn't a carpenter. I don't think much of it, it's just something I'm good at.",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP02_NIGHT_01": "I saw that Spice Vendor with yer the other night. They didn't do anythin' weird, did they? Just checking...",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP02_DAY_00": "I heard about the other debts your parents left behind! Do you need any help?",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP02_DAY_01": "You seem to have everything under control. I'm proud of you!",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP02_NIGHT_00": "Phew! I'm beat from another busy day today. I'm heading home to de-stress with some skincare!",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP02_NIGHT_01": "Remember to set boundaries for your rest time! No point in working hard if you're going to burn out!",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP03_DAY_00": "My parents work hard, but I wish they came back more often to visit. I'm sure you can relate, Pom.",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP03_DAY_01": "To be honest, I think of my grandfather as my main parent, and I want to make him proud.",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "I feel very protective over my siblings. They deserve to grow up healthy and happy.",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "I wonder if I'm doing a good job sometimes. My grandfather says I am, but you know...",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP03_DAY_00": "Has Puffer been mischievous again? The boy is full of interesting ideas...",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Life is never boring with my grandchildren around. I'm glad I have the energy to keep up!",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "Angel and Puffer like to hear me reread letters from their parents.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "Lancet tries to act tough, but I know he misses his parents too.",
    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP03_DAY_00": "Hey Pom! If you used to travel, have you ever met my mummy and daddy?",
    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Mummy and daddy sent us another letter! They're in Rempah now!",
    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "I miss mummy, but I know we're looking at the same stars at night...",
    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "Do you know the story of Princess Fennel? Mummy used to say I'm just like her!",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP03_DAY_00": "My parents travel for work, so my siblings and I live with our grandfather.",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP03_DAY_01": "One day I'll become a soldier, like Lancet! And I'll explore the world, like my parents!",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "I understand why my parents have to travel, but I wish I could see them more often.",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "I pray at the fountain sometimes, hoping my parents will visit us soon...",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP03_DAY_00": "My son is a little absent minded. I think he takes after me.",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Chia is very strong willed, and curious about the world. She's very bright!",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "Are the twins arguing again? I better go see what's going on.",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "As a parent I can't give my children all the answers. I don't think they want to hear them anyway...",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP03_DAY_00": "Chia loves her brother, but she can be very blunt when talking to him.",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Rye is such a sensitive boy. He always puts his whole heart into anything he does.",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "Oh dear, the twins are having a fight again. They'll make up eventually, but...",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "I love my children no matter what. It hurts me when they are sad, though...",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP03_DAY_00": "I love living in Paell now, but I want to move back to the city when I grow up!",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Rye is kind of silly sometimes. Why does he want to run a food cart when there are so many other jobs in the world?",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "Rye's so forgetful, what makes him think he's going to be a good chef?",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "We're still children, I don't get why Rye is so serious about the stupid food cart...",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP03_DAY_00": "Dad talked about running the food cart when he was younger. It sounds like so much fun!",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP03_DAY_01": "I don't get why Chia doesn't care about our family traditions as much as I do!",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "Chia was mean to me today. I don't want to talk to her right now...",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "I really want to travel and make people happy with food... like you do!",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP03_DAY_00": "I feel creepy, constantly lurking around Alder. Maybe I should try to talk to him...",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Should I ask Alder to make something for me? Or maybe I'll just say hi? Oh, I'm so nervous!",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "How do you do it Pom? How do you not get captivated by Alder's beautiful fur and dazzling eyes?",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "Oh dear, I don't think I can talk to Alder, I don't have the courage! Lord Galangal, give me strength!",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP03_DAY_00": "I've tried a few boba flavours now, I love them all so much I drink one a day!",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Naicha introduced a new flavour called cheese milk tea. How ingenious!",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "The air smells sweet tonight... Oh! It smells like boba!",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "The cheese milk tea is my favourite flavour! I could drink that every day!",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP03_DAY_00": "I hurt myself at the Mala Caverns the other day, but I had no time to visit the doctor.",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP03_DAY_01": "'*cough* I''m feeling slightly under the weather, but I have to work...'",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "My body temperature have been up and down today, and I can't stop shivering.",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "'*cough* I still don''t feel good, but it''s nothing a good night''s sleep can''t fix.'",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP03_DAY_00": "I think the injury Dad got the other day has become infected. I'm worried...",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Dad's not feeling well. Argh, I wish I could go to the dungeons in his place!",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "I would tell dad not to work if he feels sick, but I know he won't listen to me!",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "Mum used to cook a hot soup whenever I was sick. Maybe I'll make that for dad!",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP03_DAY_00": "Chanterelle has been out late so often recently. She says she wants to exercise more but I'm not sure...",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP03_DAY_01": "I'm a little worried about Chanterelle. I can always tell when she has a lot on her mind, but she won't tell me anything...",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "I tried following Chanterelle to see where she goes each night, but I lost her.",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "Shh, I'm trying to follow Chanterelle. I just hope she's safe and not in any kind of danger...",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP03_DAY_00": "'*yawn* I''m so tired because I got home late last night. But there are some things - or people - worth losing sleep over.'",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Love makes me do ridiculous things. But I don't regret it one bit!",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "Chanterelle is the most beautiful, big-hearted, smartest person I know!",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "Did you know Chanterelle can speak four languages? She's amazing!",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP03_DAY_00": "Isn't the weather just wonderful today? And everyone is so friendly, so warm!",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP03_DAY_01": "The world is so much brighter and cheerful when one is in love...",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "Dill knows so much about the different animals in the woods. He's so good with children too!",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "Can one fall deeper in love just looking into someone's eyes? I think so...",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP03_DAY_00": "I see Lancet sometimes when we get posted to the same location. He's a very good soldier.",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Lancet doesn't care that I used to be nobility, and said I'm just as good as any guy. It's nice to have his respect.",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "I understand why Chanterelle wants to keep her relationship with Dill private. Some nobles have narrow views on such things.",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "Have you seen the way Chanterelle looks at Dill? It's of such pure affection, I get a little envious.",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP03_DAY_00": "Ho hum, your restaurant seems to be thriving just as it did back in your parents' hay day!",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Eclair has informed me how helpful you are to Paelleans! Ho hum, well done!",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "The town is so peaceful, ho hum... a far cry from its early days.",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "I see you've inherited your parents' tenacity and positivity. Ho hum! Keep that sunny side up!",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP03_DAY_00": "You know, I used to frequent your restaurant when your parents ran it. They always treated me like a queen!",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Do stand up straight, Pom. A respectable restaurant owner does not slouch!",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "I just thought I should inform you that you're doing an impeccable job with the restaurant, Pom. Good night!",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "I'm glad there are no bandits or wild creatures roaming about the town. You can thank my husband for that!",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP03_DAY_00": "I've been really busy lately since most of my nobleman duties occur out of town.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP03_DAY_01": "It's difficult to find time to visit Orzo, but that's why I don't take it for granted!",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "I apologise but I have to get going, I have much to do back home!",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "I just dropped by to say hello to Orzo, but he didn't really seem happy to see me. I hope he's alright.",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP03_DAY_00": "Fusilli had to cancel our last two meet ups because of work. I feel a little sidelined.",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Maybe I'm not good enough to be friends with Fusilli anymore, since he's a noble now...",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "Fusilli deals with so many important people, it must be embarrassing to have a commoner friend like me.",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "I think I'm holding Fusilli back from becoming a truly significant member of the nobility.",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP03_DAY_00": "I've got a brand new boba flavour I can't wait to add to the menu! Can you guess what it is?",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP03_DAY_01": "How much do you like cheese? Because that's my new boba flavour! Cheese milk tea!",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "There's this new regular at the boba shop! He's our biggest fan! I'm so glad he likes my flavours!",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "I heard about your money troubles from Biscotti! Lemme know if you need some spare change!",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP03_DAY_00": "Naicha went a little off the rails again with her newest invention. Her ideas are always so... unique.",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Do people like cheese THAT much that they would want it in their tea?? What a strange concept.",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "I would like you to know that Naicha and I are always ready to lend you a hand if you need it. Good night, Pom.",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "Our regulars inspire me to improve on my tea making skills. It's always worth it to see their satisfied faces.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP03_DAY_00": "Biscotti mentioned you've been burdened with some financial troubles, unsurprising in this capitalist society.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP03_DAY_01": "It's fascinating how tireless you seem in your optimism. It's rather endearing as well.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "If you ever wanted a short holiday, little kitty, I could recommend a few places I've visited over the years.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "I favour the social practices from the land of Gochu. It's customary for their men to woo their partners through dance. Perhaps one day...",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP03_DAY_00": "Zhenzhu was ranting to me about Naicha's weird flavours again! I don't mind it though, she's funny!",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP03_DAY_01": "I gotta say pal, the way you tackle ya troubles head on is pretty darn inspirational!",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "I just got a brainwave for an invention!! Gotta work on it now, catch ya later!",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "I regularly meet up with the Inventor's Guild. It's awesome to hang out with like-minded peers!",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP03_DAY_00": "Briquette is always brimmin' with inventive ideas. I'm not as passionate as her, and that's okay.",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP03_DAY_01": "Hm? A new friend? 'Course I would love to make new friends, but I'm kind of shy...",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "I've been writing to my family. My parents asked about yer and wish ya well for the business and all.",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "Carpentry is just my job. After work, I like to unwind with a book. Or maybe do some knitting.",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP03_DAY_00": "If you ever need anything from my garden, let me know. Everyone says my crops are the best!",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP03_DAY_01": "No matter what happens, I'm here for you Pom! Don't give up!",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "Wow, you look exhausted! Remember to take time out for yourself if you need to.",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP03_NIGHT_01": "Please make time to rest! I'm sure your parents would prefer you didn't sacrifice your health for your job.",
    "AMBIENT_IBERICO_CHAP03_DAY_00": "Did you know that the first known taxation happened almost 5000 years ago?? How extraordinary!",
    "AMBIENT_IBERICO_CHAP03_NIGHT_00": "I love sunsets, they always give me a strong sense of peace, similar to when I file my taxes on time.",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP04_DAY_00": "I make sure my uniform is cleaned and pressed regularly. It's a mark of a good soldier.",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP04_DAY_01": "Training was tough, but the thought of supporting my family carried me through!",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "There have been sightings of a beast near the town. I must stay vigilant.",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "Puffer likes to pretend he's a soldier too. I think he will make a good one when he grows up!",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP04_DAY_00": "Lancet is the main breadwinner of our family. He's very diligent and hard working.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP04_DAY_01": "Do you sell Laksa in your restaurant? It's Lancet's favourite dish.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "Angel and Puffer have so much love and appreciation for their big brother.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "This next generation of children gives me hope for a more loving future.",
    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP04_DAY_00": "Puffer wants to be a soldier, but I want to make pretty things. Like dresses!",
    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP04_DAY_01": "Grandpa says Puffer would make a good soldier, like big brother!",
    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "Big brother works very hard for us, so we wait very hard for him to come home too!",
    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "I'm not tired yet... *yawns*",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP04_DAY_00": "Lancet said he's going to teach me the drills he learned when training to be a soldier!",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP04_DAY_01": "I really admire my big brother. He's brave, strong, but he also says it's okay to cry!",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "Grandpa said I look just like Lancet when he was my age!",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "Every night I wish really hard that I can be a good soldier too...",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP04_DAY_00": "The house has been quiet, but that's because the twins aren't speaking to each other.",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP04_DAY_01": "Do you have any advice for getting the twins to make up with each other? I'm only good at making dad jokes...",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "I really want my children to get along with each other again, I miss their energy together.",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "I think the twins need to respect each other's differing views and dreams for the future.",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP04_DAY_00": "I think both Rye and Chia deserve to have their opinions respected.",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP04_DAY_01": "I think my children are much more sensible than we give them credit for.",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "Basil and I will talk to the twins tonight to be more considerate about the other person's views.",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "Thank you for always listening to Basil and I. We don't have many friends who understand our worries.",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP04_DAY_00": "I'm not talking to my brother until he apologises. He said I was a traitor to the family!",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP04_DAY_01": "I don't want to run a food cart like my brother. I want to find out more about the world!",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "I feel bad about being so harsh to Rye. But he was really mean to me!",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "It makes me sad that Rye looks down on me wanting to find my own path...",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP04_DAY_00": "I'm not speaking to my sister until she apologises. She said I would never be a chef!",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP04_DAY_01": "Chia is the one who is betraying our traditions! I know what loyalty means!",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "I don't think Chia is right, but I guess I was being a little arrogant when I spoke to her.",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "I just wish my sister was more supportive of my dreams...",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP04_DAY_00": "I'm too scared to talk to Alder. I pray Lord Galangal will create a divine opportunity for us to meet.",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP04_DAY_01": "You don't have to introduce me to Alder! It will be strange for him, suddenly meeting a random person...",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "I asked your friend, Biscotti, for advice on talking to Alder, as you suggested.",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "You and Biscotti are very helpful and encouraging! Maybe I'll talk to Alder tomorrow...",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP04_DAY_00": "Zhenzhu said there's a new bubble tea flavour, called berry fruit tea! The name sounds so sweet!",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP04_DAY_01": "My sweet tooth is aching for more berry fruit tea! It's going to become my new favourite.",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "Berry fruit tea is my new favourite boba flavour for sure!",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "A perfect mix of sweetness and tartness... Ah, I'm going to dream about boba again tonight!",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP04_DAY_00": "I'm too weak to go to the dungeons, but if I don't work, I don't know how we will survive...",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP04_DAY_01": "Pippin wants to work as an adventurer in my place. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but we do need the income...",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "Pippin told me I was foolish to try and protect him forever. I have to admit he's not a baby anymore...",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "I've started teaching Pippin the basics for combat. I hope I don't regret it...",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP04_DAY_00": "I'm not letting my dad go back to work until he's better again!",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP04_DAY_01": "Dad's still really reluctant to train me as an adventurer, but we have no choice!",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "It was difficult but I finally convinced my dad to let me do his adventuring job!",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "I shouldn't be happy since my dad's still sick, but... I'm glad I have a chance to go visit the dungeons now!",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP04_DAY_00": "Chanterelle has been meeting up with Truffle, that soldier girl who used to be a noble. I don't think they've talked much before...",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP04_DAY_01": "I think Chanterelle is still hiding something from me. Her smiles seem a bit forced at times.",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "I think Chanterelle has caught on to me. She doesn't go out at night now.",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "Chanterelle's obviously hiding something. I wonder why she doesn't trust me enough to confide in me...",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP04_DAY_00": "I haven't seen Chan- I mean... my special someone recently. I'm hope she's okay.",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP04_DAY_01": "Chan- My special someone mentioned someone following her the other day, I think it's Rosemary, but I can't be sure.",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "Chanterelle didn't come again tonight. I'm sad but I understand she's not ready to be honest with her family.",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "Sigh... I wish I could become a person of note. I wish I was worthy to be with Chanterelle!",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP04_DAY_00": "I think Rosemary suspects I'm hiding something from her. I'm so scared she'll find out about... you know who!",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP04_DAY_01": "I'm not sure if Rosemary, or my parents, will approve of... him. Oh, I miss him so much!",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "I can't meet Dill tonight! I'm so upset!",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "I must head home! I can't afford Rosemary to find out!",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP04_DAY_00": "Chanterelle came to look for me for advice. I think she also wanted another friend to comfort her.",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP04_DAY_01": "I told Chanterelle to follow her heart, though I understand it's hard to break from the noble traditions.",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "Chanterelle reminded me of how suffocated I felt growing up in my parents' household.",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "I really empathise with Chanterelle. I know what it's like to have to keep a part of your heart secret.",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP04_DAY_00": "Did you know Paell used to be a rural area, with bandits and wild animals alike roaming freely? No one would visit, let alone live here!",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP04_DAY_01": "The way to make a town inhabitable is to clean its streets, so Paell's founder and I did just that! Ho hum!",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "Ho hum, your parents and other business owners were invited by the founder of Paell to live here. That's how we attracted tourists!",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "Did you hear the League of Cuisineers are in town? This is not the first time, but I'm thrilled! Ho ho hum!",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP04_DAY_00": "The residents of Paell are the sweetest in the world. Like that Biscotti, she always remembers how I like my tea with lots of honey!",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP04_DAY_01": "I remember I was dining in your parents' restaurant when the League of Cuisineers paid them a visit. That was an exciting day!",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "Do you think the people of this town need a holiday? Choux and I are thinking of holding a special Paell day, what do you think?",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "Your parents were accomplished restaurateurs, but they turned down the League's invitation to join them! To this day I'm not sure why!",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP04_DAY_00": "I've finished my duties back home so I can visit more often now! Orzo didn't seem too excited to see me though.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP04_DAY_01": "I thought Orzo needed a break from things so I've invited him over for a lovely holiday!",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "I've bought Orzo a few gifts to make up for my absences recently, but I don't think it's working...",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "Orzo still seems upset about something. Hopefully he'll open up and confide in me soon.",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP04_DAY_00": "Fusilli wants me to stay at his estate, as if I needed another reminder about the differences in our income!",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP04_DAY_01": "I don't want to upset Fusilli, but I feel like he pities my modest lifestyle. It's a little insulting, even though I know he doesn't mean to be...",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "The more I think about Fusilli's ignorance, the more I feel hurt and frustrated.",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "I know Fusilli means well, but I can't help but resent his words. Argh, I don't want to lose our friendship, what do I do?",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP04_DAY_00": "I DID IT! I got Zhenzhu to try something new! I got her to step outside her comfort zone!",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP04_DAY_01": "Come by and try our brand new Berry Fruit Tea soon! Zhenzhu and I are really proud of it!",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "Ankhiluun said you stood up against some arrogant League Rep? Good on you, Pom!",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "It's just like you to join the League of Cuisineers! I knew you were always one to dream big!",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP04_DAY_00": "After much consideration, I decided to try my hand at inventing a new flavour too... I do hope people like it!",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP04_DAY_01": "A man came back today to buy the new Berry Fruit Tea that I helped create. Don't tell Naicha, but I'm very pleased!",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "I just heard the news about the League of Cuisineers. What an honour it is!",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "Briquette and I were just discussing how proud we are of your progress Pom. We wish you all the best!",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP04_DAY_00": "I'm here to offer my encouragement and support, little kitty. Biscotti has been spreading the word.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP04_DAY_01": "My, my, you are frightfully impressive. I'm sure the League won't be ready for what you have to offer.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "One doesn't need extraordinary capabilities to see the heartfelt dedication you have to your restaurant.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "I'm wishing you good luck. But I'm fairly certain you don't need it.",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP04_DAY_00": "I don't know why Zhenzhu likes to pretend she doesn't like her sister. I find it rather cute!",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP04_DAY_01": "Was that someone from the League of Cuisineers at your restaurant? Holy macaroni!",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "Just getting a midnight snack! I work better at night, it's like that's when my creative juices are most alive, y'know?",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "Oh hey! I know I'm not really one to talk but shouldn't ya be gettin' some rest?",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP04_DAY_00": "Briquette said I was welcome to attend one of her Guild meetings. It's quite flatterin' she thinks I'm as capable as her.",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP04_DAY_01": "I heard about the League. Let me know if I can do anything to support yer!",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "Biscotti's been giving me advice on how to open up to new people. I think she wants me to talk to that Spice Vendor more...",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "Whenever I'm stressed I like to soak my feet in some hot water. It relaxes me somehow.",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP04_DAY_00": "I still can't believe it... the League of Cuisineers!",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP04_DAY_01": "Who was the person you said seemed interested in Alder? Anzu? I'll talk to her later then!",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "Hey, it's now more important than ever that you find time to rest! And hydrate yourself!",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "You're going to need all your wits about you if you're going to challenge the greatest chefs in the world!",
    "AMBIENT_IBERICO_CHAP04_DAY_00": "The Tax Office heard you were approached by the League of Cuisineers! Now that is an organisation that pays their taxes on time!",
    "AMBIENT_IBERICO_CHAP04_DAY_01": "'It feels like only yesterday you were paying back debts, and now look at you: competing with the League of Cuisineers!'",
    "AMBIENT_IBERICO_CHAP04_NIGHT_00": "It's been a long day! I can't wait to head home and have a nice hot bath!",
    "AMBIENT_IBERICO_CHAP04_NIGHT_01": "What shall I cook for dinner today? Maybe something simple, like baked salmon...",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP05_DAY_00": "Guarding the town is serious business, and I shoulder that responsibility with pride.",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP05_DAY_01": "Angel loves sweet things, and we're trying to feed her more fruits instead.",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "My siblings are very creative. Sometimes they create their own bedtime stories!",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I'm thankful for my siblings and my grandfather. They are my life's greatest blessings.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP05_DAY_00": "Angel and Puffer want to get their brother a gift, do you have any suggestions?",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP05_DAY_01": "Lancet makes me very proud - he's sensible, conscientious, and a decent cook!",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "Angel is craving something sweet, I thought I'd get her some fruits from the garden.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "Lancet makes time to play with his siblings every day. He's a wonderful older brother.",
    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP05_DAY_00": "Puffer looks like Lancet, who looks like daddy, who looks like grandpa!",
    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP05_DAY_01": "If I were a princess, I would want big brother to be my personal soldier!",
    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "Would big brother be happy if I made him a card?",
    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I hope Lancet isn't too tired today, I've got so much to tell him!",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP05_DAY_00": "You carry really cool weapons. I wonder if my big brother will like them?",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP05_DAY_01": "Lancet always looks really cool when he wears his uniform. I'm jealous!",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "Sometimes Lancet comes home with treats for me and Angel!",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "One day I'll be a soldier and bring treats home for Angel and grandpa too!",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP05_DAY_00": "I told Chia it's okay to want to do something different from our family traditions, so she feels supported.",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP05_DAY_01": "As parents of twins, we have to ensure we treat and validate each of them as individuals.",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "The twins are on good terms again! Phew, I feel so relieved!",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I'm glad Chia finally sees her brother's passion matches her own!",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP05_DAY_00": "I spoke to Rye, and he's glad that we're supportive of his decision to revive the food cart tradition.",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP05_DAY_01": "This is not the children's first fight, but it won't be their last. That's okay.",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "I think Rye understands his sister needs his support too!",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "The twins are getting better at understanding each other's perspectives!",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP05_DAY_00": "I get mad when Rye doesn't listen to me, but I don't think I've been listening to him either.",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP05_DAY_01": "Rye apologised for what he said to me, and I did the same. I'm glad we're not fighting anymore!",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "I'm going to respect the fact that Rye wants to follow our ancestors' footsteps!",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "Rye and I don't always have to have the same idea, because that's what makes life exciting!",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP05_DAY_00": "I haven't been kind to Chia, she's very brave to want to forge her own path.",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP05_DAY_01": "Chia and I said sorry and made up! We accept that we will always have differences in opinions.",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "I hope Chia and I can be more understanding towards each other from now on!",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "The most important thing about being siblings is to be respectful and supportive of each other!",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP05_DAY_00": "I finally did it! I plucked up the courage to say hi to Alder, and he said hi back!",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP05_DAY_01": "Alder's so friendly! And strong and dependable and warm and humble and kind...",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "I've been so nervous the whole day! But Alder was very gentle and accommodating.",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I don't think I've spoken so much to anyone else in my life. Alder's so easy to talk to!",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP05_DAY_00": "'Zhenzhu and Naicha came up with two new flavours of boba: matcha and masala tea!'",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP05_DAY_01": "Both the matcha and masala tea taste great! But now I don't know which is my favourite flavour?!",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "I wonder if Naicha put something special in her bobas. They always taste so amazing!",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I've decided Masala tea is my new favourite since it's such a unique concoction!",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP05_DAY_00": "Now I'm waiting for my son to come back from the dungeons. How the tables have turned.",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP05_DAY_01": "Pippin promised he would only stay on the lower levels of the Green Ruins. I trust him, but I'm still worried.",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "I don't think I've been this worried in my life. Seeing Pippin come back was such a relief!",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I'm really proud of my son. Imagine, such a strong and brave adventurer at his age!",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP05_DAY_00": "Finally, I'm ready to show my dad I can be a great adventurer like him! It's my turn to protect him now!",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP05_DAY_01": "I hope my dad gets enough rest and not worry too much! Wish me luck!",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "Adventuring is really, really tough, but my dad trained me well. I fought a Puffy today!",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I have to make sure my dad is taking his medicine properly! See you!",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP05_DAY_00": "I'm glad to see Chanterelle staying in nowadays. It's dangerous to be out late all the time.",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP05_DAY_01": "Chanterelle still seems depressed about something... Oh, how my heart aches for that child.",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "Chanterelle told me she was craving some sweets, so I popped out to buy some.",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I tried to talk to Chanterelle today but she's cooped herself up in her room...",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP05_DAY_00": "I walked by her today, but knowing that I couldn't hold her hand breaks my heart.",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP05_DAY_01": "How I wish I could embrace her, praise her, comfort her, love her every day!",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "I'm so happy to have Chanterelle in my arms again! I've missed her so much!",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "Chanterelle is in such pain hiding from Rosemary, so we've decided to let her know the truth.",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP05_DAY_00": "I'm so tired of hiding from Rosemary, and also from Dill. I wish I wasn't of noble blood.",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP05_DAY_01": "Being an adult complicates so many things. Why does a person's status matter at all in the first place?",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "I'm so sorry I've worried Dill. He's not angry at all that I've been absent, which is more than I deserve!",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I'm planning to tell Rosemary the truth about my relationship with Dill. I hope this is the right decision...",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP05_DAY_00": "The nobility has so many rules to follow! I'm really glad I decided to leave that world behind.",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP05_DAY_01": "I believe in Chanterelle. She's stronger than she feels, and tougher than she looks.",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "Shh, don't tell anyone but I helped Chanterelle sneak out tonight since she had to see Dill no matter what.",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I feel bad for Rosemary, but I also wonder if she would truly accept Chanterelle if she knew the truth.",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP05_DAY_00": "Ho hum! I heard you were approached by the League of Cuisineers! Outstanding work, Pom! You're putting Paell on the map!",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP05_DAY_01": "I didn't know the League rep snubbed you, Pom! Ho hum! How dare she, she's going to get a taste of that Paellean determination!",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "If you ever need any support, Eclair and I are here for you! Ho hum, go Pom!",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "Thank you for your hard work, Pom. If my friend were still alive, he'd surely call you the pride of Paell!",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP05_DAY_00": "What a coincidence! First, your parents were approached by the League, now you! Talent must run in your family!",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP05_DAY_01": "I wonder if you'll get to meet anyone famous. I've heard there's an angry Ficellian Cuisineer who loves cursing at arrogant customers!",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "At this time of year, the evening air is always ripe with gossip. I've been hearing rumours about a certain noblewoman...",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I'm terribly proud of you Pom, and I'm sure your parents must be too! All the best for the challenges!",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP05_DAY_00": "Orzo finally shared what was on his mind. I must admit I hadn't thought much about the differences in our lifestyles.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP05_DAY_01": "Orzo has agreed to come to my estate once in a while, so he can see what life is like for me!",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "Orzo and I are alright, now that I've promised to be more sensitive to his circumstances and visit more.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I need to be more aware of my privilege. I'm thankful Orzo was very understanding of my ignorance.",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP05_DAY_00": "I took your advice and told Fusilli the truth. He apologised for being thoughtless with his words.",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP05_DAY_01": "I'm still uncomfortable with differences in our social status, but I know that's not entirely Fusilli's fault.",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "Fusilli and I plan to be more open and empathetic towards each other.",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "Since Fusilli and I both cherish our friendship, I think we can work through our differences.",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP05_DAY_00": "You go, Pom! Show the League who's boss in this town!",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP05_DAY_01": "If anyone dares to play dirty in your challenges, Ankhiluun and I have a few tricks up our sleeves, if you get my drift!",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "Ya heard about our new teas yet? We got two out - masala and matcha! Guess which one I like?",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I've been working a lot more with Zhenzhu for these new teas, and it's not as bad as I thought it would be.",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP05_DAY_00": "How wonderful to hear about your successes, Pom! I hope you're happy with your efforts.",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP05_DAY_01": "If you come by our shop later, I highly recommend you try the matcha tea. It's - objectively - better tasting.",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "Naicha isn't such a bad partner to work with, actually. She's surprisingly very encouraging whenever I am met with a setback.",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I try not to let the sales of my teas affect my sense of self worth, but it is a tough thing to do. Such is the life of a creative.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP05_DAY_00": "Congratulations on your latest accomplishment, little kitty. Unsurprising, but congratulations nonetheless.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP05_DAY_01": "I hope you did not take Naicha's words too seriously, although I admit I do not take too kindly to cheating either...",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "The League challenges are bringing out many of your strengths. You're a remarkable being, little kitty.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I'm pleased to have played a modest part in your journey towards success.",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP05_DAY_00": "Folks at the Inventors' Guild are jealous I know someone challenging the League of Cuisineers! Proud of ya, Pom!",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP05_DAY_01": "To be honest, I was disappointed Alder didn't want to meet the Guild with me. But not everyone has the same fire as I do! So it's fine!",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "Zhenzhu and I were just talking about ya! All the best with the challenges, you really make us proud to be citizens of Paell!",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "You're doing great Pom, just wanted to let ya know!",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP05_DAY_00": "I made a new friend today! She said she's an admirer of my work. I was rather happy to hear it.",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP05_DAY_01": "I met Ankhiluun the other day and they were very polite. I may have misjudged them a little...",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "I hope yer getting enough rest with all your challenges. Yer doing an amazing job from what I can see!",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "As long as yer happy now, you should continue being a restaurateur. Who says you can't change yer mind later?",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP05_DAY_00": "I still think you're as good as any of the Cuisineers. Have faith in yourself!",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP05_DAY_01": "Did you see Anzu talking to Alder? Finally! All that pep talk I gave her worked!",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "Everyone's excited about your Cuisineer challenges, you're the talk of the town!",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "I've heard rumours about Cuisineer's reigning champions, apparently they're native to Paell!",
    "AMBIENT_IBERICO_CHAP05_DAY_00": "Congratulations on paying off the League entrance fee! What an impressive showcase of dedication!",
    "AMBIENT_IBERICO_CHAP05_DAY_01": "The Tax Office remains neutral in most things, but I'll admit my colleagues and I are rooting for you against the League!",
    "AMBIENT_IBERICO_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "How are you? I'll be honest, I've taken a liking to you since you're always so responsible. Do take care of yourself!",
    "AMBIENT_IBERICO_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "All the best with your challenges! I trust you'll do well, as any good tax paying citizen would!",
    "AMBIENT_KAVIAR_CHAP05_DAY_00": "Making an enemy of the League is a grave mistake.",
    "AMBIENT_KAVIAR_CHAP05_DAY_01": "It would be wise to quit ahead while you can.",
    "AMBIENT_KAVIAR_CHAP05_NIGHT_00": "Your stubbornness is probably borne from your commoner upbringing.",
    "AMBIENT_KAVIAR_CHAP05_NIGHT_01": "Headstrong tenacity can be as admirable as it is foolish.",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP06_DAY_00": "My grandfather has given me a lot of wisdom over the years. I wish I could return the favour.",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP06_DAY_01": "What is the best gift for my grandfather? He always says he doesn't need anything anymore...",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "I think spending quality time with my family makes me the happiest in life.",
    "AMBIENT_LANCET_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "This town is filled with so many personal memories. I will protect it with my life.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP06_DAY_00": "If you live as long as I do, you stop wanting things, because Life continues to give.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP06_DAY_01": "My grandchildren are the best gifts I've ever received in my life.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "I thank the stars for giving me a lovely family to care and nurture.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILIER_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "Every family may be different from each other, but it's always love that keeps them together.",
    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Shh, can you keep a secret? We're trying to find a present for grandpa!",
    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP06_DAY_01": "It's really hard to find presents for old people...",

    "AMBIENT_ANGEL_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "I'm going to write a story about Grandpa and how he teaches Lancet and Puffer to be good soldiers!",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Did Angel tell you? We're trying to think of a gift for grandpa's birthday!",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP06_DAY_01": "Lancet said if I have any ideas, he would trust my judgement completely!",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "Grandpa said he likes spending time with us, so we're going to go on more walks with him!",
    "AMBIENT_PUFFER_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "Can we eat at your restaurant tomorrow? I'll tell Lancet and grandpa!",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP06_DAY_00": "I was just telling Olive how glad I am that we moved back to Paell. We're so blessed!",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP06_DAY_01": "You know, if we lived in the city Rye would never have met you, and become so determined to be a chef!",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "Growing up is never easy, but I want to do what I can to help my children.",
    "AMBIENT_BASIL_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "I hope my children understand I'm also learning how to be a better parent for them every day.",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Basil and I agree that overall, moving to Paell was a better decision for our family.",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP06_DAY_01": "I'm glad that Chia has been exposed to a bigger world than the city we used to live in!",
    "AMBIENT_OLIVE_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "It's good that the twins have separate interests. We get them to share with each other at dinner time.",

    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Mummy said she will bring me to visit the city once in a while! I can't wait to go back!",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP06_DAY_01": "I like Paell, but I miss the city sights! I can appreciate them better now when I go back to visit!",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "Did you know there's a machine in the city that can cook an omelette without a chef?",
    "AMBIENT_CHIA_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "I told Rye maybe one day I'll be an inventor, and make robots to help with his food cart!",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Dad shared with me some of the old recipes he used when his parents ran the food cart!",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP06_DAY_01": "Dad is teaching me how to cook, but can I also come by your restaurant and see how you do it?",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "Did you know Chia really likes Pork Chop? I think that should be the first dish I learn to make!",
    "AMBIENT_RYE_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "Chia was happy with a dish I made yesterday! I really like cooking for other people!",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Oh, hello! I'm not really hiding, but I decided I didn't want to make Alder uncomfortable with my presence.",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP06_DAY_01": "Watching Alder be so dedicated to his work makes me want to find a passion for myself too..",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "I'm satisfied admiring Alder respectfully from a distance. Perhaps it's a cultural thing...",
    "AMBIENT_ANZU_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "It is enough for me that Alder knows I exist. Thank you for your help!",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP06_DAY_00": "'I''ve got a new obsession: the sparkling bubble tea! I can''t stop buying it, it''s so good!'",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP06_DAY_01": "I've decided to drink a different tea every day to so I can appreciate all my favourite flavours equally!",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "I drink Zhenzhu's matcha tea more than others, since it reminds me of my homeland of Azuki!",
    "AMBIENT_GOJI_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "I try to drink only one boba a day. 'Try' being the key word...",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP06_DAY_00": "I'm feeling a lot better now. I really needed the break after working so hard.",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP06_DAY_01": "Now that I'm stronger, I'm taking Pippin along to some of the other dungeons. He's shown he can do it!",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "My late wife would be so incredibly proud of Pippin. He's so mature and brave for his age.",
    "AMBIENT_QUINCE_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "'I''ve said it before, but I''ll say it again: I''m really proud to have a son like Pippin.'",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP06_DAY_00": "I'm really glad my dad's feeling better, but also that I could do something to help!",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP06_DAY_01": "Did you hear?! Dad's taking me to the higher level dungeons! I'm so excited!",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "You know, I realised adventuring isn't about being a hero, it's about protecting people you love.",
    "AMBIENT_PIPPIN_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "I know for sure I want to be an adventurer, like my mum, my dad, and you too!",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Chanterelle wants to introduce me to somebody who is important to her! I'm very curious!",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP06_DAY_01": "I'll check in on Chanterelle once in a while, but she's free to be with the person she loves.",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "I'm so glad I finally found out what has been troubling Chanterelle all this time! Honestly, she's been so worried for nothing at all.",
    "AMBIENT_ROSEMARY_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "The only thing I care about is Chanterelle and her happiness. I will always support her no matter what.",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Chanterelle wants me to meet Rosemary! Gosh, I'm nervous!",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP06_DAY_01": "Chanterelle and I can be together in public now! This simple act brings me so much joy!",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "Rosemary is not sure if Chanterelle's parents will support us, but she does! That's what matters for now!",
    "AMBIENT_DILL_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "Chanterelle has been so burdened and afraid, I'm so glad that weight has been lifted from her shoulders.",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP06_DAY_00": "I think in order for me to live a fulfilling life, I have to live my truth. That means being open about my relationship with Dill!",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP06_DAY_01": "I confessed to Rosemary and she said she supported my relationship with Dill! I'm so relieved!",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "I will need to tell my parents one day, but now I have Rosemary's support I feel more optimistic about it!",
    "AMBIENT_CHANTERELLE_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "Oh, I'm filled with so much joy just being here with Dill. My heart feels like it's about to burst out of my chest.",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP06_DAY_00": "I can't help but think about Chanterelle and Dill. I wish the best for them...",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP06_DAY_01": "Have you heard? Rosemary accepted Chanterelle's relationship with Dill! Isn't that great!",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "Maybe one day I'll go back to visit my parents, just to see if they've changed their minds about me...",
    "AMBIENT_TRUFFLE_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "I'm content to be with my fellow soldiers and friends who love me for who I am. They're my family now.",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Ho hum hurrah! You did it Pom! You showed the League what Paelleans are made of!",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP06_DAY_01": "I still can't believe you're a part of the League of Cuisineers. Ho hum, ho- oh, I'm going to cry again!",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "I remember during the early days, my friend believed the fountain would bring the best to Paell. I think she was right, Pom!",
    "AMBIENT_CHOUX_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "Ho hum! Without a doubt, you and your restaurant are the pride and joy of Paell!",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Congratulations Pom! You've achieved the ultimate victory, how very marvelous of you!",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP06_DAY_01": "Did you meet that famous Ficellian Cuisineer? Did he call you an idiot sandwich? How thrilling!",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "This town hasn't been boring at all since you've moved here, Pom. You're a remarkable person!",
    "AMBIENT_ECLAIR_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "I must host a party to celebrate your achievements soon, Pom! Let me know what desserts you love to eat! I'll prepare them!",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Orzo visits my estate once in a while so I can share my good fortune with him. We have great fun together!",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP06_DAY_01": "Orzo always accepted me for who I am, and I really appreciate him as a friend.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "I'm sure there will always be problems in life, but I'm ready to learn how to deal with them.",
    "AMBIENT_FUSILLI_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "As long as my mind remains open, and I have friends like Orzo, I can do anything in this world!",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Fusilli has worked really hard to reach where he is today, I'm proud to be his friend.",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP06_DAY_01": "When Fusilli visits me we walk around the neighbourhood we grew up for old time's sake.",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "I'm still learning a lot about managing my emotions in complex situations as an adult.",
    "AMBIENT_ORZO_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "I'm glad I was honest with Fusilli. I feel our friendship is a lot stronger now!",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Whoopee! Everyone look! It's the new Reigning Cuisineer Champion! I'm singing your praises forever!",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP06_DAY_01": "Guess what? Zhenzhu and I had an adult chat last night! Isn't that wild? I'm so glad she sees me as an equal!",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "I know I'm a little different from other people, but I don't let that get in the way of things, y'know?",
    "AMBIENT_NAICHA_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "My sister may be weird at times, but I love her all the same. I'm lucky to have her as family!",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Well done, Pom! I'm so proud of you. You must come by for dinner soon so we can celebrate your accomplishments!",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP06_DAY_01": "I don't tell you often enough how much you motivate me Pom. I'm so glad you've decided to move back to Paell.",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "One of our regular customers made a point to tell me how my matcha teas remind him of home. I'm honestly so moved by this...",
    "AMBIENT_ZHENZHU_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "I've always felt a little insecure around Naicha, she's everything I wish I could be. But I'll learn to accept that.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP06_DAY_00": "I find myself rather fortunate to have witnessed all your achievements first hand. Congratulations, Pom.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP06_DAY_01": "You deserve all the praises you're bound to receive, little... ah, forgive me. Pom.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "You've been through quite a whirlwind of experiences, I hope the days are a little more smooth sailing for you in the future.",
    "AMBIENT_ANKHILUUN_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "Just to let you know, if you're ever in need of some company... I'm not against engaging in a few light hearted activities with you.",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Did ya win? I knew you could do it! I knew I saw something amazing in ya!",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP06_DAY_01": "I've actually come out more often because of ya, Pom! Paell is a lot more fun when you're around!",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "If ya ever need a friend, Brilliant Briquette is always here! Unless I'm tinkering away, then ya gotta come to my house!",
    "AMBIENT_BRIQUETTE_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "So whaddya plan on doing next? A brand new menu? Maybe a renovation? Ooh! If ya need new equipment, let me know!",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Yer parents would be mighty proud if they could see yer now... Huh? What do yer mean they did?",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP06_DAY_01": "I still can't believe yer parents were the Cuisineer champions. I don't think I could fight against family like that...",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "I always find a lot of things to be grateful for at the end of the day. Old friends, a warm home, maybe some nice food...",
    "AMBIENT_ALDER_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "Seeing you during yer challenges really motivated me to try and grow a little too. Thanks Pom, have a good night!",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP06_DAY_00": "I'm so proud to be your best friend Pom! You're a true inspiration!",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP06_DAY_01": "By the way, it seems Anzu lost the courage to talk to Alder again! Sigh, it was good while it lasted.",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "Anzu seems content... I don't really get it, but maybe someday they'll be normal friends!",
    "AMBIENT_BISCOTTI_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "It's been a hectic time for you! Rest well and remember I'm here for you!",
    "AMBIENT_IBERICO_CHAP06_DAY_00": "I thought I saw a couple in town the other day who looked really familiar... They looked like your parents!",
    "AMBIENT_IBERICO_CHAP06_DAY_01": "You're a blessing to this town of Paell, Pom. It's a little unprofessional to say, but you're my favourite taxpayer!",
    "AMBIENT_IBERICO_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "Ah, the fountain is a truly lovely thing to behold in the sunset glow, don't you agree?",
    "AMBIENT_IBERICO_CHAP06_NIGHT_01": "I get the strangest sensation that something is ending, as well as beginning. What do you feel?",
    "AMBIENT_KAVIAR_CHAP06_DAY_00": "Looks like your trials have come to an end... for now. I commend all your efforts thus far.",
    "AMBIENT_KAVIAR_CHAP06_DAY_01": "You have led me to become quite curious about this town. I wonder if everyone in Paell is as driven as you are.",
    "AMBIENT_KAVIAR_CHAP06_NIGHT_00": "Nothing is certain in this world, except death, taxes and salted caramel popcorn.",

    "NAICHABIRTHDAY_ANKHILUUN_DAY_00": "Ah, little kitty, perchance have you seen the more exuberant boba sister? I owe her a little gift today…",
    "NAICHABIRTHDAY_ANKHILUUN_NIGHT_00": "Naicha possesses a refreshing sense of innovation. I am appreciative of our friendship, and the interesting ideas borne from it.",
    "NAICHABIRTHDAY_BRIQUETTE_DAY_00": "Busy, busy, busy- What? What’s going on? Naicha’s birthday? NO WAY!!",
    "NAICHABIRTHDAY_BRIQUETTE_NIGHT_00": "Ya know, maybe I should invent a Boba launcher for Naicha’s birthday! Whaddya think?",
    "NAICHABIRTHDAY_ALDER_DAY_00": "Hullo! I wished Naicha happy birthday earlier this mornin’, she seemed really thrilled!",
    "NAICHABIRTHDAY_ALDER_NIGHT_00": "Naicha said if I tried her new boba, it would count as a birthday gift. I hope I don’t regret it…",
    "NAICHABIRTHDAY_BISCOTTI_DAY_00": "'I know what I’m getting Naicha: cake! And not just any cake, but a boba-flavoured one! Genius, right??'",
    "NAICHABIRTHDAY_BISCOTTI_NIGHT_00": "That Ankhiluun gave Naicha some weird spices and now she’s made a new boba flavour from them! I suggest you hide before she asks you to try it!",
    "ZHENZHUBIRTHDAY_NAICHA_DAY_00": "Psst, don’t tell Zhenzhu, but I’m preparing something super duper extra special for her birthday gift! She’s gonna love it!",
    "ZHENZHUBIRTHDAY_NAICHA_NIGHT_00": "It’s ready! Don’t worry, it’s not any of my boba, although honestly, Zhenzhu could afford to be a bit more experimental with her tastes.",
    "ZHENZHUBIRTHDAY_ZHENZHU_DAY_00": "Oh, Pom! I thought about celebrating my birthday this year by showing my appreciation for my friends, so thank you for always being here for me!",
    "ZHENZHUBIRTHDAY_ZHENZHU_NIGHT_00": "I really hope Naicha hasn't decided to gift me her latest boba flavour creation. I'm not always a big fan of them...",
    "ZHENZHUBIRTHDAY_ANKHILUUN_DAY_00": "As Naicha’s acquaintance, it’s proper to wish Zhenzhu a happy birthday. You know me, always one for propriety. Hah.",
    "ZHENZHUBIRTHDAY_ANKHILUUN_NIGHT_00": "I did provide Naicha with some assistance for her sister’s gift. Unfortunately, I am not at liberty to share its details, little kitty, however persuasive you may be.",
    "ZHENZHUBIRTHDAY_BRIQUETTE_DAY_00": "'Before you ask: I did remember Zhenzhu’s birthday! I even have a gift ready for her! Aren’t ya impressed?'",
    "ZHENZHUBIRTHDAY_BRIQUETTE_NIGHT_00": "Zhenzhu reads a lot so I gave her a small trinket that dusts her books, to keep her collection clean! She loved it!",
    "ZHENZHUBIRTHDAY_ALDER_DAY_00": "Zhenzhu tried to refuse my gift for her birthday, but I wouldn’t let her. She reminds me of one of my sisters, a very, very kind person.",
    "ZHENZHUBIRTHDAY_ALDER_NIGHT_00": "'I hope Zhenzhu liked my present: I carved a set of wooden coasters for her Boba drinks. If you''d like, I could make a set for yer!'",
    "ZHENZHUBIRTHDAY_BISCOTTI_DAY_00": "Even though she seems a bit too strict at times, Zhenzhu really has such a big heart. You can tell she really loves Paell and its people.",
    "ZHENZHUBIRTHDAY_BISCOTTI_NIGHT_00": "What a pleasant day it has been! Perhaps it’s because it was Zhenzhu’s birthday? It must be!",
    "ANKHILUUNBIRTHDAY_NAICHA_DAY_00": "Oops, sorry, gotta rush! I’m just making some final adjustments to Ankhiluun’s birthday present!",
    "ANKHILUUNBIRTHDAY_NAICHA_NIGHT_00": "Ankhiluun was so surprised with my gift! Which meant they loved it! It takes a lot to surprise them, you know? Woohoo!",
    "ANKHILUUNBIRTHDAY_ZHENZHU_DAY_00": "Naicha was up all night in the kitchen, but by the sounds I’m not sure if she was cooking or building something…",
    "ANKHILUUNBIRTHDAY_ZHENZHU_NIGHT_00": "Ankhiluun was polite as always when I wished them happy birthday, but I can’t actually tell if they liked my greeting…",
    "ANKHILUUNBIRTHDAY_ANKHILUUN_DAY_00": "Well now, normally I'd find birthday wishes trivial, but it's a little different coming from you, little kitty. Thank you.",
    "ANKHILUUNBIRTHDAY_ANKHILUUN_NIGHT_00": "This day passed like any other, but I admit there was a tingle of felicity. For enlightening my mirth, I'd like you to have a... fringe benefit from my birthday.",
    "ANKHILUUNBIRTHDAY_BRIQUETTE_DAY_00": "Huh, did I forget another birthday? Wait, Ankhiluun? Oh… well I’m not that close to them…",
    "ANKHILUUNBIRTHDAY_BRIQUETTE_NIGHT_00": "I wished Ankhiluun earlier and they were really surprised that I knew it was their birthday! Thanks for reminding me, pal!",
    "ANKHILUUNBIRTHDAY_ALDER_DAY_00": "Biscotti did mention it was Ankhiluun’s birthday, but I’m still not very acquainted with them. Do yer think I should wish them happy birthday?",
    "ANKHILUUNBIRTHDAY_ALDER_NIGHT_00": "Ankhiluun's so mysterious. But when I saw them earlier they seemed happier than normal. Guess they secretly like birthdays, huh?",
    "ANKHILUUNBIRTHDAY_BISCOTTI_DAY_00": "Ankhiluun didn’t want a birthday party, sadly, but they seemed glad to have tea with me earlier!",
    "ANKHILUUNBIRTHDAY_BISCOTTI_NIGHT_00": "I can’t change how Ankhiluun lives their life, but I still wish they had more friends in Paell. They're just as much a part of Paell as you are!",
    "BRIQUETTEBIRTHDAY_NAICHA_DAY_00": "Briquette is hilarious, she didn't even remember that it's her birthday today! I could never forget my own birthday.",
    "BRIQUETTEBIRTHDAY_NAICHA_NIGHT_00": "Zhenzhu said she’s going to have dinner with Briquette, so I reminded her to have cake for dessert!",
    "BRIQUETTEBIRTHDAY_ZHENZHU_DAY_00": "I'm going to surprise Briquette with a birthday dinner tonight. It's so easy to surprise her because she never remembers it!",
    "BRIQUETTEBIRTHDAY_ZHENZHU_NIGHT_00": "I'm not sure why, but I feel very relaxed around Briquette! She genuinely looks out for me and always knows how to cheer me up.",
    "BRIQUETTEBIRTHDAY_ANKHILUUN_DAY_00": "Hm? Whose birthday? Ah, the tiny, blue-haired firecracker inventor... She would probably like firecrackers as a gift, don't you think?",
    "BRIQUETTEBIRTHDAY_ANKHILUUN_NIGHT_00": "I saw Briquette with Zhenzhu, the more elegant boba sister. A rather odd pair, but I suppose there are stranger combinations in the world.",
    "BRIQUETTEBIRTHDAY_BRIQUETTE_DAY_00": "Wait, what? It's my birthday?! Well, hot diggity, what am I doing here then? I should be inventin'! See ya!",
    "BRIQUETTEBIRTHDAY_BRIQUETTE_NIGHT_00": "Argh... no luck today. If only I invented something as impactful as the oven! Or the toaster! Now THAT would be a birthday to celebrate!",
    "BRIQUETTEBIRTHDAY_ALDER_DAY_00": "I once taught Briquette how to make a stool, and she let me try a hand at soldering. 'Twas mighty interestin' to learn about each other's craft!",
    "BRIQUETTEBIRTHDAY_ALDER_NIGHT_00": "I made Briquette a cup and a holder with magnets inside 'em so they'll stick to each other. That way she won't spill her drink while inventin'!",
    "BRIQUETTEBIRTHDAY_BISCOTTI_DAY_00": "There's no point planning a birthday party for Briquette. I did that before and she didn't turn up! I guess big events aren't her thing.",
    "BRIQUETTEBIRTHDAY_BISCOTTI_NIGHT_00": "Briquette works really hard to impress that Inventors' Guild of hers, but personally I think they're fools who can't recognise an amazing inventor like her!",
    "ALDERBIRTHDAY_NAICHA_DAY_00": "Aww I can't wait to give Alder my present! Zhenzhu and I came up with it together, which is more surprising than the gift itself!",
    "ALDERBIRTHDAY_NAICHA_NIGHT_00": "You know, if Zhenzhu and I had an older brother, I'd want him to be just like Alder - superbly sweet, even if one of us drives him crazy!",
    "ALDERBIRTHDAY_ZHENZHU_DAY_00": "I used to be quite intimidated by Alder, before I understood how incredibly compassionate he was and what a lovely older brother he is to his siblings!",
    "ALDERBIRTHDAY_ZHENZHU_NIGHT_00": "One time Naicha and I had a fight and Alder made me feel supported while reminding me of my older sibling duties. I really respect him for that.",
    "ALDERBIRTHDAY_ANKHILUUN_DAY_00": "The carpenter is a well-loved member of this quaint little community, isn't he? I doubt he'll miss my well wishes amidst the swarm he will receive.",
    "ALDERBIRTHDAY_ANKHILUUN_NIGHT_00": "'Birthdays are really just society’s capitalistic traps distracting us from the truth: we are all just cogs of a machine, little kitty. Don''t forget it.'",
    "ALDERBIRTHDAY_BRIQUETTE_DAY_00": "I'm about to make a breakthrough! I just need to bounce a few ideas with my fellow craftsman... wait, is it Alder's birthday today?? Oh crap!",
    "ALDERBIRTHDAY_BRIQUETTE_NIGHT_00": "Whew, it was a rush-job but I got Alder a little something I made myself! Better late than never, amiright?",
    "ALDERBIRTHDAY_ALDER_DAY_00": "My birthday? Ah, it's nothin' special, really, but I appreciate the well wishes!",
    "ALDERBIRTHDAY_ALDER_NIGHT_00": "My family sent me a few birthday gifts but I don't really need them all... Oh, would yer like some?",
    "ALDERBIRTHDAY_BISCOTTI_DAY_00": "Did you wish Alder happy birthday? He's awfully humble, but I bet he loves everyone remembering that it's his birthday today!",
    "ALDERBIRTHDAY_BISCOTTI_NIGHT_00": "One thing I love about Alder is his dedication to his family - and I'm pretty sure they are devoted to him too!",
    "BISCOTTIBIRTHDAY_NAICHA_DAY_00": "You know, I always remember everyone's birthdays, but I don't have to do that for Biscotti - she makes sure everyone remembers hers!",
    "BISCOTTIBIRTHDAY_NAICHA_NIGHT_00": "I'm feeling really inspired today, maybe I should make a new boba flavour after Biscotti! She'd love that!",
    "BISCOTTIBIRTHDAY_ZHENZHU_DAY_00": "What lovely weather we're having today, almost as if the heavens are smiling down on Paell. It must be because it's Biscotti's birthday!",
    "BISCOTTIBIRTHDAY_ZHENZHU_NIGHT_00": "Paell had a few rough years due to low crop yield and poor trade. I don't think we would've survived without Biscotti's tenacity and ingenuity!",
    "BISCOTTIBIRTHDAY_ANKHILUUN_DAY_00": "I’m indebted to Biscotti, she was an invaluable presence when I first moved to Paell. I greatly admire the depths of her generosity.",
    "BISCOTTIBIRTHDAY_ANKHILUUN_NIGHT_00": "Gift giving is not my forte, but I'm confident Biscotti will appreciate my present... Oh? Is that envy I'm detecting, little kitty?",
    "BISCOTTIBIRTHDAY_BRIQUETTE_DAY_00": "I know I'm forgetting something... What is it... A wrench? A drill press? Maybe a caulking gun... Oh, wait! It's someone's birthday today, isn't it??",
    "BISCOTTIBIRTHDAY_BRIQUETTE_NIGHT_00": "The best thing about Biscotti is that her boldness isn't just for show! She always puts her food where her mouth is! Did I say that right?",
    "BISCOTTIBIRTHDAY_ALDER_DAY_00": "Biscotti and ya were so inseparable back in the day, I remember forgettin' when yer birthdays were 'cause yer always celebrated together!",
    "BISCOTTIBIRTHDAY_ALDER_NIGHT_00": "I might not have Biscotti's confidence, but 'm sure yer already gave her the best birthday gift ever by coming back to Paell! She missed ya a lot.",
    "BISCOTTIBIRTHDAY_BISCOTTI_DAY_00": "Hey Pom! It's my birthday today, so I've decided to spread some Biscotti cheer with some special party favours. I hope you liked yours!",
    "BISCOTTIBIRTHDAY_BISCOTTI_NIGHT_00": "It only seems like yesterday when we were running around the fountain playing pirates, Pom! Birthdays always make me feel so sentimental.",
    "COOKINGARENA_CHALLENGE_FINALFAIL_01_01": "That's too bad, you were so close!",

    "NBQUEST_18_SUCCESS_01": "Thank you so so much for your help, I have to go complete my designs now, but not before you receive your reward!",
    "NBQUEST_18_FAIL_00": "My lovely Pom, this is very kind of you but I have already completed my outfit.",
    "NBQUEST_18_FAIL_01": "It is not the best since I had to replace the feathers with something else, but there is no time left to make any changes! The Ficellian runway calls!",
    "NBQUEST_19_SUCCESS_00": "I say, your presence has always been a delight but it is absolute euphoria right now!",
    "NBQUEST_19_SUCCESS_01": "Thank you so so much, Pom, you've saved my photoshoot from utter ruin!",
    "NBQUEST_19_SUCCESS_02": "Here is the reward I promised, and my lifelong gratitude. Hugs and kisses, my dear!",
    "NBQUEST_19_FAIL_00": "Oh! Thank you Pom but it's past the deadline I put in my poster, so the photoshoot is already done!",
    "NBQUEST_19_FAIL_01": "Jeera Bhaat was content with my efforts but I think I could have done better. If only I had the prop earlier...",
    "NBQUEST_20_SUCCESS_00": "Oh, Pom, I could cry! This is exactly what I need right now.",
    "NBQUEST_20_SUCCESS_01": "With mental health, sometimes the smallest good deed makes the biggest impact.",
    "NBQUEST_20_SUCCESS_02": "I am so utterly thankful my friend. Please take this as a token of my appreciation! I insist!",
    "NBQUEST_20_FAIL_00": "What a surprise! I had such a tough week I completely forgot that I made that request.",
    "NBQUEST_20_FAIL_01": "I'm fine now though, a little R-and-R goes a long way! Perhaps you can give it to someone else who needs it.",
    "NBQUEST_21_SUCCESS_00": "Thank you so much Pom! I was starting to feel crazy, hallucinating juicy steaks in front of me...",
    "NBQUEST_21_SUCCESS_01": "I can't wait to eat some juicy beef tonight!",
    "NBQUEST_21_SUCCESS_02": "Mama mia, I nearly forgot your reward! Here it is!",
    "NBQUEST_21_FAIL_00": "Oh! I thank you kindly, Pom, but I have no need for this anymore.",
    "NBQUEST_21_FAIL_01": "I have satisfied my cravings with a substitute ingredient for now. Maybe next time, eh?",
    "NBQUEST_22_SUCCESS_00": "What a blessing you are, my friend.",
    "NBQUEST_22_SUCCESS_01": "'You have no idea how much my parents and I appreciate this: we''re going to make this dish together as a family.'",
    "NBQUEST_22_SUCCESS_02": "Thank you, here's a gift for your trouble.",
    "NBQUEST_22_FAIL_00": "Unfortunately, I have no use for this right now. My parents found the ingredients in the end and we've already made the dish.",
    "NBQUEST_22_FAIL_01": "Next time try to bring it to me earlier, yes?",
    "NBQUEST_23_SUCCESS_00": "Brava, Pom! I had a feeling you would be the one to fulfil my request. You have lived up to my expectations, well done!",
    "NBQUEST_23_SUCCESS_01": "Now I'm off to try my special recipe, please accept this as payment for your efforts.",
    "NBQUEST_23_FAIL_00": "My friend, sadly you are a little late and I no longer require this equipment. I wish you a good day.",
    "NBQUEST_24_SUCCESS_00": "You're so sweet Pom! I thank you on behalf of my daughter, because she is going to eat very healthy tonight.",
    "NBQUEST_24_SUCCESS_01": "Thank you thank you. Oh yeah, I found something as a reward... here it is!",
    "NBQUEST_24_FAIL_00": "Eh? I think this was for yesterday or something, right?",
    "NBQUEST_24_FAIL_01": "My daughter eat already, and I bought enough vegetables for now. So I don't need this anymore, sorry!",
    "NBQUEST_25_SUCCESS_00": "Oh! Pom! I didn't realise you would be helping me!",
    "NBQUEST_25_SUCCESS_01": "Thank you... don't tell anyone, okay? It's just a side hustle I have and the people I work with...",
    "NBQUEST_25_SUCCESS_02": "Actually, I've said too much ah. Here's your compensation!",
    "NBQUEST_25_FAIL_00": "Huh? What task? What material? I didn't ask for anything ah.",
    "NBQUEST_25_FAIL_01": "No, no, you probably mistook it for my name. I have nothing to do with the- I mean, never mind. It wasn't me! Bye!",
    "NBQUEST_26_SUCCESS_00": "Wow, this is really sturdy! Thank you thank you!",
    "NBQUEST_26_SUCCESS_01": "I'm going to be the best student. Maybe one day I'll teach you some of the martial arts moves I learned.",
    "NBQUEST_26_SUCCESS_02": "Ah, I need to go, here's your payment! Bye!",
    "NBQUEST_26_FAIL_00": "Pom, thank you ah, but you're a little late. I thought no one would get it for me so I went to get my own! Sorry, I'll call you again for next time!",
    "NBQUEST_27_SUCCESS_00": "Ah, there you are. I thought it would be you.",
    "NBQUEST_27_SUCCESS_01": "Your reputation precedes you Pom, I am glad to see the rumours of your skill have not been exaggerated.",
    "NBQUEST_27_SUCCESS_02": "Thank you for your time.",
    "NBQUEST_27_FAIL_00": "Pom! What a surprise, I'd have expected you to be a bit more attentive to the details of my poster.",
    "NBQUEST_27_FAIL_01": "The deadline has passed so I do not require the ingredients anymore. Perhaps next time you'll be faster!",
    "NBQUEST_28_SUCCESS_00": "Oh, you are a sight to behold, Pom. Thank you for your speedy assistance!",
    "NBQUEST_28_SUCCESS_01": "Don't forget to take your reward!",
    "NBQUEST_28_FAIL_00": "Ah, my friend, I was so hungry I could not help myself from eating something first. It is unfortunate but I don't need this dish anymore. Apologies!",
    "NBQUEST_29_SUCCESS_00": "Excellent job, Pom. This is exactly what I needed, and such high quality too!",
    "NBQUEST_29_SUCCESS_01": "Adventurers like you are the rarest diamonds in the world. I'm grateful for your efforts.",
    "NBQUEST_29_SUCCESS_02": "Here's the payment I promised.",
    "NBQUEST_29_FAIL_00": "I regret to inform you that I no longer require these materials. Once the deadline passed I thought it would be faster for me to get them myself.",
    "NBQUEST_29_FAIL_01": "Thank you for your time though, I appreciate the thought.",
    "NBQUEST_30_SUCCESS_00": "What exquisite rays of light! This is high quality material, indeed.",
    "NBQUEST_30_SUCCESS_01": "Pom, you've clearly outdone yourself, I only wish I had something better to reward you with. Wish me luck for my paintings!",
    "NBQUEST_30_FAIL_00": "This is a kind thought, Pom, but I had a burst of inspiration after I posted up the request so sadly, I have no need for the materials any longer.",
    "NBQUEST_30_FAIL_01": "Apologies for the confusion!",
    "NBQUEST_31_SUCCESS_00": "Brilliant!",
    "NBQUEST_31_SUCCESS_01": "BRILLIANT!",
    "NBQUEST_31_SUCCESS_02": "Absolutely brilliant, Pom. You've saved my art today, and thoroughly deserve my reward! Now I must be off, see you!",
    "NBQUEST_31_FAIL_00": "My painting? Ah, fortunately I found a way to complete it without the ingredient. Or should I say unfortunately, given your wasted trip.",
    "NBQUEST_31_FAIL_01": "Thank you though, perhaps you can assist on my next painting instead.",
    "NBQUEST_32_SUCCESS_00": "Amazing work Pom! I wish I had something more interesting for you to cultivate your sensibilities, but I suppose this reward will do.",
    "NBQUEST_32_SUCCESS_01": "Thank you once again, and do pay me a visit when I'm done with redecoration.",
    "NBQUEST_32_FAIL_00": "Oh dear. Did you not see the deadline on the poster I put up? It was pertinent that the required materials reached me by then.",
    "NBQUEST_32_FAIL_01": "Since you're past it, maybe you can give them to someone else. Sorry about that!",
    "NBQUEST_33_SUCCESS_00": "Pom, this is amazing! Thank you so much, you have no idea how much I appreciate you doing this for me.",
    "NBQUEST_33_SUCCESS_01": "And my potted plants are honoured as well! I'm more than happy to hand over the reward, hope you like it too.",
    "NBQUEST_33_FAIL_00": "Oh... Thank you Pom. Sadly, a lot of my plants died so I won't need any additional nutrients or fertiliser for a while...",
    "NBQUEST_33_FAIL_01": "Now excuse me, I just want to go cry in the corner...",
    "NBQUEST_34_SUCCESS_00": "....Ommmmmy god! Thank you so much Pom!",
    "NBQUEST_34_SUCCESS_01": "Wow, look at how beautiful the material is. I feel peaceful just looking at it already.",
    "NBQUEST_34_SUCCESS_02": "Thank you again, I hope you like my reward!",
    "NBQUEST_34_FAIL_00": "Hmm? What is thi- OH! For my bench! Oh wow, thank you so much Pom but er...",
    "NBQUEST_34_FAIL_01": "My brothers got the materials for me in the end so I don't need anything from you anymore. Sorry!",
    "NBQUEST_35_SUCCESS_00": "How lovely of you to do this for me, Pom! I know there is a reward for this, but I'm still so glad you decided to take the time to help me.",
    "NBQUEST_35_SUCCESS_01": "It means a lot more to me than you realise. Have a great rest of your day!",
    "NBQUEST_35_FAIL_00": "I'm terribly sorry Pom, but it's past the deadline for the dinner party so unfortunately I will not require the dish anymore.",
    "NBQUEST_35_FAIL_01": "Hopefully, you can enjoy it yourself in some way. Thanks again.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_00_SUCCESS_00": "GOOD ADVENTURER, YOU HAVE FULFILLED OUR REQUEST. WE ARE MOST SATISFIED.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_00_SUCCESS_01": "THANK YOU. PLEASE ACCEPT OUR TOKEN OF APPRECIATION.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_00_FAIL_00": "WE'RE AFRAID THIS REQUEST HAS EXPIRED, FURTHERMORE WE HAVE ALREADY ARRANGED FOR A CATERING SERVICE.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_00_FAIL_01": "THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_01_SUCCESS_00": "Oh! It's you! Thank you so much Pom! I'm so excited to see why Ald- I mean, what all the fuss is about for prawn.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_01_SUCCESS_01": "Yes, that's why I asked for this dish... Here's the reward I promised! Thank you again!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_01_FAIL_00": "Ah, Pom... About that... I think I'm going to stick to what I know I love. Besides, I've just eaten so I don't think I can stomach another dish.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_01_FAIL_01": "Thank you though, and sorry for making you go through all that trouble!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_02_SUCCESS_00": "This dessert looks positively delicious, I can't wait to have it with my boba!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_02_SUCCESS_01": "Oh yes, speaking of which... I accidentally drank the boba I meant to reward you with, so I hope you don't mind taking this instead! Thanks again, Pom!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_02_SUCCESS_02": "Thanks again, Pom!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_02_FAIL_00": "Oh! Erm... I'm so sorry, I don't really want a dessert anymore...",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_02_FAIL_01": "Well, you see... the thing is... I accidentally drank the boba I meant to use as a reward? It was a special order so I was really curious about the taste!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_02_FAIL_02": "But it was also a large serving so I'm awfully full now. I'm so sorry...",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_03_SUCCESS_00": "Words fail me, Pom. Thank you so much! You are as selfless as you are brave, my friend.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_03_SUCCESS_01": "Please take this as your reward, I found it while scavenging in the swamps.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_03_SUCCESS_02": "I suspect that's what provoked the Oractopi in the first place, and I think you deserve to possess it instead.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_03_SUCCESS_03": "All hail, Adventurer Pom the Brave!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_03_FAIL_00": "You did what?? Wow, you're a fine specimen of an adventurer, Pom!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_03_FAIL_01": "My friends actually managed to escape the Oractopi before you killed them, but well done! Remember to stay safe in the dungeons!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_04_SUCCESS_00": "Oh, Great Adventurer Pom! You are my saving grace, the light in a dark tunnel, wherein the other side lies the bright and glorious Chanterelle...",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_04_SUCCESS_01": "Ah, apologies! I get so poetic thinking of her. Thank you for the crystals and here is your compensation! Wish me luck!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_04_FAIL_00": "Pom! Thank you so much but err I don't want it any more? I mean, I don't need it right now.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_04_FAIL_01": "Chanterelles' parents are so intimidating I doubt even all the jewels in the world would impress them.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_04_FAIL_02": "Sigh... Maybe I'll just appreciate what we have for now.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_05_SUCCESS_00": "My word, this is incredible! I must admit, while I have the utmost respect for Fusilli, I did have my doubts coming to commoners for my suit.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_05_SUCCESS_01": "I did not think anyone would come close to retrieving the desired materials, and yet here you are! Bravo.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_05_SUCCESS_02": "Here is your reward as pledged. Good day to you!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_05_FAIL_00": "I say, aren't you Pom the Adventurer?",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_05_FAIL_01": "I've heard grand things about you and your restaurant from Fusilli, though perhaps being a restaurateur has slowed you down.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_05_FAIL_02": "After all, the deadline for my request has already passed, so I'm having my moonstones imported from Bauernbrot instead.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_05_FAIL_03": "At least you get to keep all the moonstones you found! Isn't that nice?",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_06_SUCCESS_00": "Amazing! Thanks so much Pom, this is exactly what I needed.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_06_SUCCESS_01": "I can't wait to turn them into friendship badges for me and Fusilli! Here's your compensation, hope it's to your liking!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_06_FAIL_00": "Aw man, I'm so sorry Pom but someone beat you to it and gave me the materials I needed!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_06_FAIL_01": "I've already paid them as well as the blacksmith to craft the badges for me and Fusilli.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_06_FAIL_02": "Sorry again! Better luck next time!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_07_SUCCESS_00": "Pom, you've got your heart in the right place, alright. This is so kind of you, thank you so much for doing this.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_07_SUCCESS_01": "Angel and Puffer are mighty excited for their breakfast, and I'm sure Lancet has worked up an appetite.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_07_SUCCESS_02": "Don't forget to take your reward now, you deserve this.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_07_FAIL_00": "Young one, your heart is in the right place. Paell is lucky to have you.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_07_FAIL_01": "But regrettably, my family and I have had our breakfast already, and you're a bit too late for that.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_07_FAIL_02": "Apologies for your trouble, Pom!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_08_SUCCESS_00": "Thanks for this. We really just wanted to show Olive how much we appreciate her, y'know?",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_08_SUCCESS_01": "Lavender fusses a lot, which probably gives Olive the wrong idea about how we see her.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_08_SUCCESS_02": "Anyway, here's your payment. Cheers.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_08_FAIL_00": "Hm? What's all this now? We don't need it anymore, the dinner party is over.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_08_FAIL_01": "Lavender made a big fuss and invited all our relatives to it, nearly embarrassed Olive to tears. Thankfully, they were happy tears.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_08_FAIL_02": "Anyway, you're too late. Hope you know what to do with all that food.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_09_SUCCESS_00": "Thank you Pom! I hope the kitty enjoys the food I bring him... or her... it...?",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_09_SUCCESS_01": "Do I have to cook the food? Maybe I should ask Grandpa? I'll go ask Grandpa first.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_09_SUCCESS_02": "Open your hand! This is your present. Thank you!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_09_FAIL_00": "Hello Pom! Oh, the kitty disappeared.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_09_FAIL_01": "I don't know where it went, and I'm still a little sad actually. But maybe it went back to find its family?",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_09_FAIL_02": "At least it won't be hungry. I don't need the fish anymore, you eat it! Bye!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_10_SUCCESS_00": "You have undertaken what appears to be a simple task at hand, but the weight of your actions will ripple through the House of Lactarius forever.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_10_SUCCESS_01": "Thank you for your generous endeavour, Adventurer. I pray The Sister Goddesses of Sweet watch over you.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_10_FAIL_00": "Thank you for your generous endeavour, Adventurer. But unfortunately you've missed the crucial hour of importance with your tardiness.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_10_FAIL_01": "We no longer require your services. I pray The Sister Goddesses of Sweet watch over you.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_11_SUCCESS_00": "Of course. I should've known you'd come running to my aid.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_11_SUCCESS_01": "No time for chit chat I'm afraid. I hope you accept my humble gratitude and this small prize Thwon and I have prepared for you.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_11_SUCCESS_02": "I do appreciate you... not telling anyone else about this. Until next time, little kitty.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_11_FAIL_00": "Dear me, what do we have here? You've been rather conscientious throughout our interactions, but I do believe you're mistaken about this.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_11_FAIL_01": "I never made any such request, and I don't have any friend named Thwon.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_11_FAIL_02": "Let's henceforth forget that this ever occurred, shall we? I'll see you around, little kitty.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_12_SUCCESS_00": "Yay thanks Pom! Puffer and Rye are going to be so excited. We just started learning how to play football.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_12_SUCCESS_01": "The champion footballer Rawon said that anything can be football, as long as we have fun!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_12_SUCCESS_02": "Oh, here's the prize we promised! Thanks again!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_12_FAIL_00": "Oh... thanks Pom but Puffer, Rye and I don't want to play football anymore.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_12_FAIL_01": "It was just something we wanted to try but we're bored now and decided to play something else. Sorry!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_13_SUCCESS_00": "Praise Tamar, you're finally he- YOU??",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_13_SUCCESS_01": "What are you- How did you- Why did the League- You know what, I don't even want to know.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_13_SUCCESS_02": "Obviously, you've fulfilled our task, but just know that it wasn't my idea to ask you.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_13_SUCCESS_03": "Sigh... here's your reward then. Now, go away.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_13_FAIL_00": "Hm? What are you talking about? The League would never ask commoners for such an important mission!",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_13_FAIL_01": "You may know how to run a restaurant, but don't get too big-headed.",
    "NBQUESTONETIME_13_FAIL_02": "Anyway, it seems even if you undertook this task, you've obviously failed to keep within the deadline. Perhaps you need to undergo more training.",

    "SPRINGREUNION_BASIL_NIGHT_00": "Painting and hiding so many eggs around town was tiring, but the look of joy on my kids' faces makes it all worth it.",

    "SPRINGREUNION_OLIVE_NIGHT_00": "Luckily both Rye and Chia love eggs. It's hard to find food they both agree on since they are such picky eaters.",
    "SPRINGREUNION_CHIA_DAY_00": "I told Rye to be careful while he was searching for eggs because he can be so clumsy. Did you know he almost fell into the fountain???",
    "SPRINGREUNION_CHIA_NIGHT_00": "Dad said I was a little mean to Rye, so I gave him some of my eggs as an apology.",

    "SPRINGREUNION_QUINCE_NIGHT_00": "I wonder where Pippin is? I hope he didn't wander too far on his egg hunt...",
    "SPRINGREUNION_PIPPIN_NIGHT_00": "Oh no... I got too caught up in my egg hunt and lost track of time! My father's going to be so worried!",
    "SPRINGREUNION_ROSEMARY_NIGHT_00": "I finally found Chanterelle but she seemed rather distracted. Perhaps she misses her parents...",
    "SPRINGREUNION_DILL_NIGHT_00": "The flowers are blooming beautifully tonight. I wonder if she can sneak out for an evening stroll...",
    "SPRINGREUNION_CHANTERELLE_NIGHT_00": "This would be the perfect night to be with the love of my life...",
    "SPRINGREUNION_TRUFFLE_NIGHT_00": "The town has always been welcoming to me, some even invited me to their family reunions. Change may be hard, but it is easier with found family.",

    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_FUSILIER_NIGHT_00": "It has always been a tradition to make a wish as you release a lantern into the sky. What would you wish for?",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_ANGEL_DAY_00": "The town already looks so pretty! I can't wait to see what it looks like tonight!",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_ANGEL_NIGHT_00": "Look Pom! The lanterns are glowing, let's make a wish!",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_PUFFER_DAY_00": "Lancet has to work hard on days like these to ensure the festival goes well safely. I hope he doesn't feel lonely.",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_PUFFER_NIGHT_00": "I wished to be strong enough so I can patrol alongside my brother one day!",

    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_BASIL_NIGHT_00": "Have you tried lighting up one of the lanterns? Rye nearly burnt his in his excitement!",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_OLIVE_DAY_00": "It's always nice to see Chia and Rye having fun with the other kids.",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_OLIVE_NIGHT_00": "The town is gorgeous, I'm so glad we choose to stay in Paell.",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_CHIA_DAY_00": "Dad said that if we make a wish while releasing a lantern it'll come true! But I don't know what to wish for yet!",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_CHIA_NIGHT_00": "The way the lanterns light up the night sky is so magical! I don't think it would be the same in the city!",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_RYE_DAY_00": "I'm going to cook a feast for my family tonight while we enjoy the beautiful lights!",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_RYE_NIGHT_00": "My dream is to be the greatest chef ever! That includes being better than you, Pom.",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_ANZU_DAY_00": "I... I wish Alder would notice me today...",

    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_PIPPIN_NIGHT_00": "It's weird but when I see all the lights, I feel like my mum is with me and dad. That's nice, isn't it?",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_ROSEMARY_DAY_00": "Chanterelle looks extremely excited today, I'm glad she is finding joy in little things.",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_ROSEMARY_NIGHT_00": "Oh I've lost sight of Chanterelle, I wonder where that silly girl is.",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_DILL_DAY_00": "I hope I can see Chanterelle tonight. I bet she'll look wonderful in the lights.",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_DILL_NIGHT_00": "I'm so grateful I was able to spend time with Chanterelle tonight! My stomach are still full of butterflies...",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_CHANTERELLE_DAY_00": "I hope to see Dill tonight. It'll be nice to admire the festival lights together!",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_CHANTERELLE_NIGHT_00": "Dill was so sweet to me. I even made a wish that our love would be eternal! A little silly, but still...",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_TRUFFLE_DAY_00": "Festivals like these make me wish I could go back to my family...",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_TRUFFLE_NIGHT_00": "I miss my family, Pom. But I'm also proud of how far I've come on my own strengths. It's a bittersweet feeling.",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_CHOUX_DAY_00": "Do you have a special pasta menu for today? Ho hum, I would love to try it if you do!",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_CHOUX_NIGHT_00": "Ho hum! I love the smiles the festival brings to the citizens in Paell, but the one on my wife's face is my favourite!",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_ECLAIR_DAY_00": "Choux will be spending most of his time interacting with the townsfolk today. That is to be expected, of course.",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_ECLAIR_NIGHT_00": "I thought Choux would be spending our time with the townspeople, but he surprised me with a special spicy meal!",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_FUSILLI_DAY_00": "I'm going to surprise Orzo later, it'll be like the old days before I became a noble!",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_FUSILLI_NIGHT_00": "It's nice to have a friend during these festivals, beautiful sights like these need to be experienced together!",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_ORZO_DAY_00": "I wonder if Fusilli will come over today to celebrate the Fireflame Festival. It'll be nice to see him.",
    "FIREFLAMEFESTIVAL_ORZO_NIGHT_00": "Fusilli and I had a lovely catch-up today! I hope our friendship will last forever and ever.",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_LANCET_DAY_00": "I feel like I'm melting. Patrolling under the sun is a terrible idea.",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_LANCET_NIGHT_00": "Drinking a cold drink during Coco Celebration is such a great way to cool down.",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_FUSILIER_DAY_00": "Remember to drink up my dear child, it's rather warm today!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_FUSILIER_NIGHT_00": "Did you go around and gather any coconuts? Puffer found plenty!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_ANGEL_DAY_00": "It's sooooo hot, I feel like I will never be cold again!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_ANGEL_NIGHT_00": "The decorations are so pretty, Pom! Which is your favourite?",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_PUFFER_DAY_00": "I hope Lancet is alright patrolling the town all day, maybe I should bring him some coconut juice!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_PUFFER_NIGHT_00": "Look at all the coconuts I've found! We're going to have coconut juice for days!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_BASIL_DAY_00": "Coco Celebration is a fun day for the children to play around.",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_BASIL_NIGHT_00": "Remember to drink water! I always have to remind Rye and Chia to drink more at this time of year.",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_OLIVE_DAY_00": "I love the decorations they set up for Coco Celebration, something about it just feels so... refreshing.",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_OLIVE_NIGHT_00": "I'm glad it's so cooling during the night, that's the best thing about summer, isn't it?",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_CHIA_DAY_00": "It's really warm in the summer... Did you know there's a machine in the land of Azuki that can cool a whole room down?",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_CHIA_NIGHT_00": "I collected some coconuts with Rye today! Did you collect any?",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_RYE_DAY_00": "I wonder what kind of food you can make with coconuts? Surely it can't just be coconut juice!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_RYE_NIGHT_00": "Do you know you can collect some coconuts from palm tree pots around the town? Chia and I collected a bunch of them!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_ANZU_DAY_00": "I wonder if Alder is working today...",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_ANZU_NIGHT_00": "Hopefully Alder keeps himself hydrated in such warm weather.",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_GOJI_DAY_00": "It's so hot! You can never go wrong with a good boba tea in the summer.",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_GOJI_NIGHT_00": "I wonder if there's a coconut-flavoured bubble tea? It sounds like an interesting drink!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_QUINCE_DAY_00": "Pippin really loves the decorations around town, it feels like we're on a tropical island.",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_QUINCE_NIGHT_00": "I've got some coconuts for Pippin. After all, you can't celebrate Coco Celebration without coconut juice.",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_PIPPIN_DAY_00": "Try shaking the palm trees, you might get something!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_PIPPIN_NIGHT_00": "I tried out the float, it was soooo fun!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_ROSEMARY_DAY_00": "This heat is getting to me! I do hope Chanterelle is well hydrated...",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_ROSEMARY_NIGHT_00": "When Chanterelle was young, her favourite thing to do was run around and shake the palm trees! She's grown so much since then...",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_DILL_DAY_00": "Have you seen Chanterelle? If you do, can you let her know I'll be waiting for her here?",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_DILL_NIGHT_00": "All the decorations make me want to bring Chanterelle to the beach one day.",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_CHANTERELLE_DAY_00": "I always carry my umbrella with me. This weather is simply too hot to travel without one.",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_CHANTERELLE_NIGHT_00": "Coconuts are super popular for Coco Celebration. I wonder if Dill likes coconut juice...",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_TRUFFLE_DAY_00": "Good day, Pom! How are you going to celebrate today?",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_TRUFFLE_NIGHT_00": "The beach decorations have such a cooling vibe, I just want to jump onto the float right now!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_CHOUX_DAY_00": "It's so bright and sunny today! That's the perfect weather for Coco Celebration!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_CHOUX_NIGHT_00": "Ho hum! I hope you've enjoyed yourself today Pom. Particularly the decorations!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_ECLAIR_DAY_00": "Choux is always so active when it comes to festivals.",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_ECLAIR_NIGHT_00": "A coconut nearly landed on Choux's foot while he was shaking the palm tree pot. My husband can be so amusing!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_FUSILLI_DAY_00": "Ah... It's too warm, I just want to stay at home all day.",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_FUSILLI_NIGHT_00": "Orzo dropped by to pass me this coconut drink, how thoughtful of him!",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_ORZO_DAY_00": "I might drop by Fusilli's later for Coco Celebration! His place is much more cooling...",
    "COCOCELEBRATION_ORZO_NIGHT_00": "Remember to drink up, Pom! Coconut juice is a great choice in this weather.",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_LANCET_DAY_00": "Have you seen the carts around town? They're so nicely decorated for the Harvest Jubilee.",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_LANCET_NIGHT_00": "I love it when food is being shared. Have you tried some of them?",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_FUSILIER_DAY_00": "Celebrating our bountiful harvest during this festival is a wonderful way to show how rich the soil was.",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_FUSILIER_NIGHT_00": "This year's harvest was abundant. We give thanks to the three Sisters, Su, Glu, and Fru.",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_ANGEL_DAY_00": "What are you going to do for Harvest Jubilee? I'm going to carve some pumpkins with grandpa!",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_ANGEL_NIGHT_00": "I got some sweets from Puffer and carved some pumpkins! Today has been so fun!",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_PUFFER_DAY_00": "Grandpa said there's hidden candy around! I'm going to find them all!",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_PUFFER_NIGHT_00": "I found some candy and shared them with Angel, she loves all the orange ones!",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_BASIL_DAY_00": "The harvest this year has been great! We've got so much food!",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_BASIL_NIGHT_00": "Back in the city, it's difficult to fully appreciate where the food comes from because you're so far from the harvest. I'm glad I live in Paell now.",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_OLIVE_DAY_00": "Rye told me he wanted to contribute to this year's Harvest Jubilee by cooking something. I can't wait!",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_OLIVE_NIGHT_00": "I'm so proud of my twins learning more about the harvest, moving to Paell was a great choice.",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_CHIA_DAY_00": "I'm looking for some sweets to share with the family! Would you like some too?",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_CHIA_NIGHT_00": "I didn't know so much of our food came from the ground! I thought they just appeared in the shops!",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_RYE_DAY_00": "I told mum I'll cook something to share, maybe something with sweet sap.",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_RYE_NIGHT_00": "Did you know some dishes taste better when you use fresh ingredients? Knowing when to harvest them is so important!",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_ANZU_DAY_00": "Sweet sap... Sweet Alder... Maybe I should harvest some and give it to him.",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_ANZU_NIGHT_00": "I'm too scared to pass the sweet sap I gathered... Maybe next year!",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_GOJI_DAY_00": "I requested for some sweet sap in my drink today! Maybe I should have asked for less sugar! I'm so energetic now!",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_GOJI_NIGHT_00": "If Naicha creates a pumpkin-flavoured boba, I would definitely be the first to try!",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_QUINCE_DAY_00": "I'm going to bring Pippin to the merchant carts today, the decorations there are splendid, and I could stock up on some things.",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_QUINCE_NIGHT_00": "I hope you got some special goods from the merchant!",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_PIPPIN_DAY_00": "Ohhh! There are so many sweets around town! I'm going to grab some of them.",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_PIPPIN_NIGHT_00": "Dad and I got a ton of stuff from the merchants today! I can't wait for our adventures!",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_ROSEMARY_DAY_00": "Have you checked the merchant carts today? I heard there are some special items on sale.",
    "HARVESTJUBILEE_ROSEMARY_NIGHT_00": "The baskets are filled with sweet saps! I hope you collected some of them.",

Sometimes he talks about the people of the Bird's Eye Islands and how much he respects them. If asked why, he will reveal that he is grateful that they respect rugs by taking their shoes off indoors. In his spare time, Hojicha can be seen fretting about his skincare routine.\\n\\nStrangely never seen alongside Wakoucha or Sencha on the same day...",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_WAKOUCHA": "A travelling painting merchant who visits Paell on Bitter days.\\n\\nWakoucha is a professional painter who strongly believes that one's showcase of true passion towards a craft is through their emotions. Not unexpectedly, he holds high standards for the paintings he makes, and only sells those he deems 'good'. Painting is his life and his love, so he spends his free time painting, sometimes using unconventional materials.\\n\\nStrangely never seen alongside Hojicha or Sencha on the same day...",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_SENCHA": "A travelling plant merchant who visits Paell on Umami days.\\n\\nSencha is a professional horticulturist. One with nature, this green thumb cultivates plants with much love and care, selling them only in the most pristine of conditions.

She has expressed interest in cosplay and enjoys watching people express themselves and their passion through their different outfits. Where some may think 'Eyes are the window to the soul', Pastel De Nata would like to argue that outfits too, can speak volumes about one's personality and soul.\\n\\nPastel De Nata truly believes everyone is unique and has their own signature shown through their clothing, if only more people would pay attention to it.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_PORCINI": "A noble merchant who graces Paell with their presence on Sour and Salty days.\\n\\nPorcini was born in Ciupeta and is now a travelling merchant while in search of their birth parents. Despite their looks and mannerisms, Porcini values emotions much more than money, and holds the power of sentimental value and memories in high regard. As they have been raised in a strict but loving environment, Porcini has extremely high standards and a strong work ethic. They only want the best for their customers and will only sell goods of supreme quality.\\n\\nPorcini may be looking for their birth parents, but they aren't doing so necessarily to reconcile with them. Porcini just wants answers and closure. To Porcini, their real family are the ones who took Porcini in and raised them to be the person they are today.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_DOUFU": "A carefree trader who visits Paell on Sour and Salty days.\\n\\nDoufu is like everyone's relative, always reminding customers to eat healthy and drink lots of water. They have a daughter who they love very much, and for her sake, they go around travelling and trading their wares while meeting people from all over the world. When they do get free time, they enjoy practising martial arts and honing their skills.\\n\\nDoufu may be a travelling merchant, but that isn't actually their only job... They may or may not have a questionable side hustle.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_IBERICO": "The local taxman of Paell.\\n\\nDue to the nature of his job, Iberico is very serious about his work and cannot tolerate people who cut corners, or people who do not file their taxes on time. In reality, he really dislikes chasing people for taxes because he feels like a villain, but he understands it has to be done for the sake of the town. That being said, Iberico makes his approval of someone known if they actually pay their taxes on time, and respects them for respecting his precious time.\\n\\nWhile Iberico is a hard worker, he is a strong advocate of good work life balance. Off the clock, he indulges in his hobbies and favourite food, letting his worries melt away until the next work day arrives.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_KAVIAR": "A noblewoman who represents the League of Cuisineers.\\n\\nThe gatekeeper of any challenger who wants to have a try at the League, Kaviar is unrelenting in her mission to recruit only the best for the League of Cuisineers. She is skeptical of almost everyone she meets and has almost impossibly high standards, but for good reason, as she believes that seeing one perform is the best way to judge one's skill.\\n\\nKaviar may come across as pompous by those who do not know her well, but in reality, her respect just needs to be earned by someone worthy. If one is able to prove her wrong and win the challenges, Kaviar is more than ready to accept them into the League.",

    "ENEMY_DESC_PUFFY": "A common critter that is weak alone, so it thrives in large groups. Their cute and fluffy appearance belies the threat within, and they are especially dangerous when cornering their prey in large packs.\\n\\nDid I mention they're REALLY fluffy?",
    "ENEMY_DESC_CHICKEN": "Despite originally being runaway chickens from the local farms, they have gradually made a place for themselves in the ecosystem of various perilous dungeons.\\n\\nSimilar to Puffies, they usually travel in groups, though their tendency to flee when attacked makes them less of a threat. It also makes them a pain to track down, so many of them escape to live another day.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_BULLIE": "Hot-headed bulls that can't resist charging at anything and everything they see. They coexist peacefully with other inhabitants of the dungeons, until adventurers step into their lair.\\n\\nOnce they have their sights set on their foe, they will unrelentingly chase them to the ends of the world, making them a dangerous enemy for many who dare venture into the dungeons.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_BLACK_BULLIE": "Even hotter-headed bulls that can't resist charging at anything and everything they see.\\n\\nLike their counterparts, once they have their sights set on their prey, they will unrelentingly chase them to the ends of the world. They are so angry that their emotions have manifested physically, often leaving flames in their tracks... Truly a terrifying species few would wish to encounter.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_PEEGIE": "A pillowy marshmallow of a beast - Their round and squishy appearance makes them a fan-favourite among children, but that is quickly changed by the way they attack.\\n\\nInstead of charging at their enemies, these pigs prefer taking a roundabout way and... dispense a cloud of poison instead. If left alone, they are hardly a threat, but once startled, they become deadly and capable of incapacitating adventurers.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_LOOT_PIGNATA": "A golden marshmallow on four stubby legs, found rarely with their counterparts, the Peegies.\\n\\nDue to their golden sheen and tusks, these elusive pigs are in danger of going extinct from Potchers constantly trying to poach them. As a result, seeing one is extremely rare and promises at least a year of good fortune. When they are startled, they react like Peegies and will dispense a cloud of deadly poison... Or they might just run away squealing.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_KAILAN": "A small pea-like creature reminiscent of Kailan leaves from Mian, which clearly influenced its name.\\n\\nThese little critters travel in small groups of 3 and prefer to stick to themselves. They are herbivorous so they thrive on the grass found in the dungeons. These curious creatures tend to shoot at anything they see, even if their projectiles may not reach their target. This makes them a surprising threat to unsuspecting enemies and adventurers alike, as they may be pelted from a distance without warning.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_TOMMAY": "Very similar in appearance to the Kailans, Tommays are often described as \\\"Kailans but red/angry\\\" by locals.\\n\\nInstead of shooting out vegetables, Tommays shoot out tomatoes that cover quite a large area at a time. Highly territorial creatures, Tommays often get into civil wars with each other. Unfortunate adventurers and enemies may sometimes get caught in the crossfire of these disputes, a position none envy.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_PEWTATO": "These creatures closely resemble potatoes, which is how they got their name.\\n\\nSpewing explosive potatoes out of their gaping mouths that then explode into multiple potato slices, this creature is one feared by many adventurers.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_CHEELEE": "Ranked number one on children's list of \\\"Pets I want but cannot have\\\", Cheelees are affectionately known as little chilli dogs by locals.\\n\\nTheir adorable appearance makes them extremely popular between youths and adults alike. Their only flaw is that they spew fiery embers when threatened, and is also the only reason why few have tried to domesticate Cheelees.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_SWEEKY": "Sweekies prefer staying safely nearby other inhabitants of the dungeons, and shoot out sticky sap from afar. The sap alone causes little harm, but it does slow down those unfortunate enough to step into it, and can be the cause of many adventurers' downfall when surrounded by enemies.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_WILD_RICE_SPRITES": "A warrior from the Wild Rice tribe.\\n\\nArmed with a kernel of rice, these sprites may be small but pack a punch. These creatures are territorial and always travel in large packs, usually with a Wild Rice Rallyman or Wild Rice Shaman. They tend to be at the frontlines of battle, protecting their Shaman and Rallyman while receiving buffs in exchange. Together, they form an unbreachable fortress and the only way to take them out reliably is to separate the warriors from the rest of their tribe.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_WILD_RICE_RALLYMAN": "A rallyman from the Wild Rice tribe.\\n\\nUnlike the warrior rice sprites, these members of the tribe tend to stay behind and let the others do the fighting. The backbone of any battle, Wild Rice Rallymen play an important role by providing attack buffs to their fellow rice sprites, enhancing their combined strength even further. Often protected by the warriors, this is the first enemy adventurers have to defeat if they want any hope at winning a battle against the tribe.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_WILD_RICE_SHAMAN": "A shaman from the Wild Rice tribe.\\n\\nLike the Wild Rice Rallyman, these sprites do not venture to the frontlines during battle and instead focus on buffing the warrior sprites. If paired with a rallyman, the tribe is nearly undefeatable, as the shaman gives buffs that will protect the warriors, while the rallyman increases their strength. Any adventurer unlucky enough to encounter a tribe of warriors, rallyman, and shaman have it tough and may be better off just fleeing.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_SAMURAI_CRAB": "A crab that wields a katana, and takes great pride in its swordsmanship.\\n\\nFrom afar, it looks calm and collected, but if any careless adventurer comes across it, they had best be prepared to run. These crabs will chase after their prey while brandishing and swinging their sharp blade at anything in their way. Retreat may sometimes be the only option when it comes to these creatures.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_SHIELD_CRAB": "A crab that wields a hard shield, and takes great pride in its ability to guard itself and those around it when needed.\\n\\nJust like the Samurai Crab, the Shield Crab is generally in a state of relaxation and non-hostility. However, if adventurers come too close, these creatures can get very defensive and start using their shield to ram into any poor adventurer or prey in their way. They may not be too much of a threat, but if they happen to be near any Samurai Crabs, be prepared to retreat.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_CANNON_SHRIMP": "A shrimp which has an unusually large pincer that is actually a cannon.\\n\\nNo one knows how it evolved to have a cannon as its pincer, but everyone knows they don't want to get blasted by its powerful beam. Cannon shrimps are capable of tracking their prey's every movement and will rotate their beam accordingly, so the best way to counter these crustaceans is to sneak behind them and deal a final blow.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_REVOLVER_SHRIMP": "A shrimp which has a pincer that shoots out quick bursts of projectiles.\\n\\nAlthough they are not able to shoot very far, these creatures are quick to react and fire at anything that moves once they are alerted. They may not have as wide a range as the cannon shrimp, but is formidable nonetheless, especially if paired with a Cannon Shrimp.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_ORACTOPUS": "A very angry octopus who has somehow gotten its tentacles into boxing gloves.\\n\\nAnyone who approaches it may find themselves the target of a flurry of punches. Its attacks only enhanced by its long reach, Oractopi are deemed as one of the biggest threats in the Frozen Fjord.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_SPOREST": "A large tree that has existed in the dungeons for an exceedingly long period of time.\\n\\nThe Sporest can summon many tiny Sporelings to catch prey for it, establishing a symbiotic relationship with the Fungi of the dungeons.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_SPORELINGS": "Red little mushrooms that come from Sporests. They chase their prey at a terrifyingly fast speed. These little devils have evolved to explode upon reaching their destination, possibly making them an even bigger threat than a single Cheelee.\\n\\nSometimes, they come in blue as well.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_SUGAKANE": "An old tree and a distant relative of Sweekies.\\n\\nUnlike Sweekies, they are more aggressive and can deal physical damage to their enemies by stabbing their roots through the ground until it reaches their prey. Sugakanes prefer to be left alone, and those who come too near a Sugakane may have to watch out for a circular ring of spiky roots - the Sugakane's defence mechanism.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_EXPLOCONUT": "A wobbly looking palm tree with what appears to be coconuts on its leaves.\\n\\nIn reality, only some of those are real coconuts. When the Exploconut feels a threat nearby, it will drop these explosive fruit, which explode after a few seconds. It is rather defenseless by itself, but good luck getting past those deadly traps.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_ICE_KUBE": "A natural inhabitant of the Frozen Fjord.\\n\\nIts cold body makes it perfect for living in the Frozen Fjord, but not anywhere else. It relies on the gaseous substance around its body to lure enemies, and freezes them with icy spikes that emerge from the ground. Due to its body being made of literal ice, Ice Kube is not a popular prey for many, so it can thrive alongside other creatures without worrying about being consumed.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_POTCHER": "A humanoid being who always has a pot on its head and hunts inhabitants of the dungeon for their materials and meat.\\n\\nIt is unknown if the Potcher actually originated from the dungeons, or is part of a bigger group outside that runs underground poaching activities. Regardless, they are very hostile and will attack adventurers and monsters alike.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_BIG_BLACK_CHICKEN": "The defender of the Green Ruins.\\n\\nThe Big Black Chicken is covered in countless spiky feathers, which it also uses to attack its prey. Thankfully for inhabitants of the dungeon, this monster is rather huge and the redness of its comb and wattle alerts all of its arrival so they can flee in time. Those who are unable to flee however, will become the target of sharp feathers and may not be able to escape alive.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_ALPHA_BULLIE": "The defender of the Mala Caverns.\\n\\nThe Alpha Bullie is related loosely to the Bullie and Black Bullie, and definitely shares their bad temper. Its horns are half the size of its head and are the most deadly part of this monster.\\n\\nThe Alpha Bullie is unbelievably strong and if it wanted to, could make walls crumble and rain boulders down. Adventurers tend to avoid the Mala Caverns because of this beast and inhabitants of the Mala Caverns know not to mess with the Alpha Bullie.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_CLAWBER": "The defender of the Frozen Fjord.\\n\\nClawber's shell is hard like cast iron, and cannot be easily shattered. As if that wasn't enough, Clawber also carries a spiked club wherever it goes, though no one knows how and where it attained such a weapon.\\n\\nClawber has also been recorded to dig underground to ambush its enemies with an unexpected attack. Luckily for adventurers, Clawber is native to the Frozen Fjord, and its black eyes stand out against the white snow so it can easily be spotted. Still, this is a formidable enemy that not many can handle.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_ALPHA_SWEEKY": "The defender of the Konpeito Swamps.\\n\\nAlpha Sweeky - the big boss of Sweekies, and a hundred times more terrifying. \\n\\nAdventurers who have encountered the Alpha Sweeky and survived to tell the tale warns about its Farewell Gift. The Alpha Sweeky will spring into the air and leave a bomb behind, which explodes into a large puddle of sweet sap. If any prey gets caught in this puddle, they may truly have to bid farewell to life.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_BIG_MAMA_HEN": "The Guardian of the Green Ruins.\\n\\nPart griffin, part chicken, this beast rules over the Green Ruins with an iron claw, alongside her chickens. The Big Mama Hen is an intimidating monster that lies in wait for any brave adventurer who makes it to the last floor of the Green Ruins.\\n\\nGenerally quite relaxed, the Big Mama Hen only attacks when she feels threatened, or when the safety of her chickens is being compromised. Despite being a griffin, the Big Mama Hen is often mistaken as a large hen as she sleeps with her wings folded and claws tucked in, making her look like just any other chicken.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_GREAT_GHOST_PEPPER": "The Guardian of the Mala Caverns.\\n\\nThe Great Ghost Pepper brandishes a huge scythe and floats around on the final floor of the Mala Caverns. It may have a cute face, but is very terrifying when it gets mad and has its sights set on any prey.\\n\\nDue to the dangerous nature of the Mala Caverns, few have gone deep enough to see the Great Ghost Pepper, and fewer survive that encounter. Because of its ghostly appearance and scythe, many adventurers liken the Great Ghost Pepper to the Grim Reaper.\\n\\nA fitting name considering the lives it has taken.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_ARTILLERY_SHRIMP": "The Guardian of the Frozen Fjord.\\n\\nThe Artillery Shrimp resembles some sort of dragon more than a shrimp, and is huge compared to the cannon and revolver shrimps. It shoots deadly lasers out of its large pincers, before charging at its prey.\\n\\nThis double assault makes it hard for adventurers to fight against the Artillery Shrimp, as they have to look out for both its projectiles and its sharp pincers. As if that wasn't enough, the Artillery Shrimp can also burrow underground and catch its prey by surprise, making it even more challenging to fight.",
    "ENEMY_DESC_KONPEITO_KING": "The Guardian of the Konpeito Swamps.\\n\\nThe current chieftain of the Potchers, the Konpeito King is clad in stolen riches and embedded Konpeito Crystals. It is exceptionally good at close combat, but is not ashamed to call for help from Potchers or use traps to ensnare its opponents. It is near impossible for any adventurer to flee from the Konpeito King, as it can leap huge distances in an instant. Once its opponent is within reach, the Konpeito King will unrelentingly thrust with its spear.",

It was love at first sight since the very first time he helped Chanterelle, and he wants nothing more than to prove his worth to Chanterelle and her family.\\n\\nDill is usually very careful, but ever since he fell in love with Chanterelle, he has thrown caution to the wind and is only concerned about looking for more gifts for his beloved partner.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_CHANTERELLE": "A noble lady in love with Dill.\\n\\nChanterelle was born with a silver spoon in her mouth, but she has fallen in love with the gentleman Dill, who happens to be a commoner. Knowing that their relationship may not be looked upon kindly by the other nobles and her parents, Chanterelle secretly meets up with Dill whenever she can. \\n\\nAs much as she worries about her parents and her maid Rosemary finding out about her relationship with Dill, Chanterelle believes that Dill is THE one for her and goes against all odds to be with him.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_TRUFFLE": "A soldier who was once a noble lady.\\n\\nTruffle has long left her days of nobility behind to chase her dreams of becoming a soldier. She enjoys both the satisfaction of keeping the town safe and the excitement of combat equally, and sometimes works with Lancet. Truffle was also Chanterelle's childhood friend, and is one of the few people who know about and support Chanterelle and Dill's secret relationship.\\n\\nTruffle really loves her family, but when her parents strongly disagreed with her wanting to become a soldier, she left her family to pursue her own happiness.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_CHOUX": "A generous and kind nobleman of high status.\\n\\nFriends with the founder of Paell, Choux has been around long enough to see Paell grow from a small rural area to a bustling town. He is wedded to the lovely Eclair and clearly dotes on her very much. Choux was also friends with Pom's parents and was thus very supportive of her reopening the restaurant, believing that it will become the pride of Paell once again.\\n\\nChoux's favourite pastime is to reminisce about how far the town has come since he first founded it with the founder of Paell.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_ECLAIR": "A generous and kind noblewoman of high status.\\n\\nEclair is married to Choux and was friends with the founder of Paell. She loves her husband and his dedication Paell. Like Choux, Eclair wants the people of Paell to be safe and happy, so she was very supportive of Pom reopening Potato Palace. Choux is her very pride and joy, and Eclair makes it very clear that she is extremely proud of her husband's achievements and contributions to Paell.\\n\\nSometimes Eclair gets a little upset that Choux is spending too much time on Paell's safety and the citizens' happiness, but Choux always reassures her and showers her with love. What a loving husband!",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_FUSILLI": "A nobleman who rose from commoner status after starting his own business.\\n\\nOnce a commoner like his best friend Orzo, Fusilli now lives just outside Paell for work. He worked very hard when he was younger, made his riches, and has joined nobility since. Despite his higher status now, Fusilli still comes back to Paell often to meet Orzo, and is not hindered by the difference in their statuses, for Orzo's friendship means much more to him.\\n\\nNow a nobleman, he has to be more cautious about what he says, so he likes reminiscing with Orzo about the good old days of childhood where they were just reckless kids running around the fountain without a care in the world.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_ORZO": "A commoner who is best friends with Fusilli the nobleman.\\n\\nUnlike Fusilli, Orzo was born and is still a commoner. He loves spending time with Fusilli and appreciates the fact that his old friend couldn't care less about their difference in societal standing. Although Orzo loves spending time with Fusilli, sometimes he worries about tainting Fusilli's pristine reputation with his 'poor' status as a commoner. These are things he finds hard to say to Fusilli and inwardly worries about while constantly joking around with the nobleman himself.\\n\\nEven though many things bother Orzo, he is still very, very thankful that Fusilli remains friends with him, and is secretly glad that Fusilli's heart has not changed even after obtaining his riches.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_SHIRATAKI": "One of the three judges in the Cooking Arena.\\n\\nHead chef of the Kaiseki restaurant chain in Azuki, Shirataki has impossibly high standards, and favours flavours that are more complex and require more mastery. Having been in the industry for decades, Shirataki is skeptical and a strong believer that actions speak louder than words.\\n\\nHe was invited to be a judge after accomplishing various feats in the culinary world, and many both in and outside of Azuki look up to him.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_KAMINI": "One of the three judges in the Cooking Arena.\\n\\nKamini Bhaat is a renowned actress from Karipatta, who took time off her busy schedule to come as a judge, but being a huge foodie, she doesn't mind it at all. Kamini really enjoys food with spices and strong flavours, and likes watching people remix classic dishes with their own spin, especially if they use ingredients from her hometown.\\n\\nSister to Jeera Bhaat, Karipatta's top model, Kamini has forged a name for herself using her own skills and talent as an actress. She is clearly well-known, seeing as she was invited as a judge to such a prestigious place.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_RAWON": "One of the three judges in the Cooking Arena.\\n\\nRawon is the reigning champion of Balado's National Football Team, who was invited to be a judge after his 5th win in a row. Known to be hot-headed, Rawon enjoys cuisine that can cool him down and likes treating himself to some desserts after a well-played match. Very excitable and hyper, the air is never still when Rawon is around, who loves chowing down on all kinds of food, as long as they are made with passion.\\n\\nA success story in his country and even in Paell, Rawon is a strong believer that dreams can come true with hard work and perseverance. Take it from the man who used to play football with coconuts.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_BANHXEO": "The first challenger Pom will face in the Cooking Arena.\\n\\nA Cuisineer from the land of Hotieun, head chef at Mount Hoa's renowned Namvieet Hotel, and once won the Iron Peppercorns many years ago. He has many years of experience under his belt, looks down on challengers who have not made a name for themselves in the culinary world, and is more than eager to teach them a lesson or two about how REAL cooking is done.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_XIAOLONGBAO": "The second challenger Pom will face in the Cooking Arena.\\n\\nOwner of the Transparent Diamond Jade Sweet Choon Dynasty... Western Liang Eastern Palace River of Forgetfulness... La Mian Lo Mein Kitchen Paradise Restaurant, Xiaolongbao may be young but she is definitely recognised for her skills. Owing to her youth, she has a tendency to get overexcited and comes up with ridiculous names for her dishes, as evident in her only restaurant. \\n\\nHer hometown of Mian absolutely spoils her with attention, shooting her up the global ranks as a renowned chef. However, the fact that she is able to stay up there with the best of the best is a true testament to her skill.",
    "JOURNAL_DESC_BOURGUIGNON": "The third challenger Pom will face in the Cooking Arena.\\n\\nA Ficellian chef with restaurants in Ficelle, Ciupeta, Nareznoy, Bourguignon is equally known for his culinary expertise, and foul language. He can sound very harsh in the way he speaks and is quick to dispense criticism where necessary. This strict attitude is a huge barrier to those who he deems unworthy of entering the culinary world, so his staff are made of only the best of the best who have proven able to withstand the heat of the kitchen...
